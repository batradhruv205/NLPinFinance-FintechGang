C04-13,8btrsv,What's the most important programming language for a quant analyst/trader to know?,1523567953.0,47,56,"I've been getting some mixed answers all suggesting C++, Python, R, Java, etc. But what would you say is the most important? I heard that most of the infrastructure is in C++ but that C++ is getting old or replaced? Not sure",0.84,"['[deleted]', 'I have ben a software engineer for 20+ years and work in big data / quant and have used Java, Python, Scala and related langauges for many years, and before that C++, C, and a other languages.\n\nProbably the reason you\'re getting mixed answers is that the language itself doesn\'t matter that much, most modern languages are converging in terms of features, syntax.  It\'s a bit like Spanish, French, Italian and Portugese (but not say Chinese or Finnish), once you know one of them it\'s not hard to learn the others. C++ is somewhat of an exception, it is a much older language with different syntax and more closely tied to the hardware and memory system.\n\nWhat matters more is the toolkits that you learn in each environment, and each toolkit is typically tied to certain languages.  Those take much longer to learn and help you do specific things.  You can think of this as the vocabulary, idioms and culture of the language.\n\nFor example Hadoop and Spark are popular ""big data"" tools, Hadoop was written mostly in Java and Spark mostly in Scala, but you can use either toolkit in either language, and can also use them in Python.\n\nR is a relatively new language and is good for quick and dirty data/quant analysis and is slowly being incorporated into other frameworks.\n\nBecause of all this you generally aren\'t expected to know the exact language/tool combination a company is using, but to have basic data/quant/stats/math skills and know enoguh about the related technologies that you can learn whatever they are using when you get there.  So your specific background doesn\'t matter as much as the amount and breadth/depth.', ""C++ is not for quants. C++ is used to write matching/booking engines(infrastructure), all the stuff that has to mmap enormous loads of data as fast as possible for trading. It's not for analysis, its for performance on boat loads of market data in real-time.

As long as it gets the job done. A big consideration is libraries. Some languages have a very rich ecosystem of libraries (especially python, due to its heavy use in academia and scientific circles). Pick one that will let you focus on what you want to do rather than needing to reinvent the wheel badly every time you need something that isn\'t provided.\n\nAlso, your programming competence. Languages like C/C++, although they\'re very powerful, are probably quite difficult to learn for beginners, and can be frustrating to debug. But for speed, they\'re the daddies.  Python, Java and other modern languages tend to abstract a lot of the low level stuff away, so are more closer to how someone ""thinks"". Specialist languages like R are powerful, but likely require a bit of specialist knowledge, and the communities can be a bit niche.', ""I work at a market maker/proprietary trading firm, I can confirm that Python is the #1 language the company is pushing it's employees to master"", 'Out of those languages, Python and R are kinda in the same family, and C++ and Java kinda in the same family.\n\nIf you are super serious, I\'d say pick one of Python and R, and C++. \n\nPython and R are interpreted languages. They allow for much more rapid coding / prototyping / experimenting than C++ and are much more ""forgiving"". Things that should intuitively work actually intuitively work in those languages. I like Python over R because of my personal history. I know R has a more exhaustive library of fancy statistical function; Python has a more extensive overall set of libraries. \n\nC++ is a compiled language, and I\'d personally only go through the pain of writing something in C++ if speed and hardware control really, really, really mattered. Most often it doesn\'t.\n\nPython with libraries such as Pandas, Zipline / Quantopian, Seaborn, Numpy is FANTASTIC for prototyping and backtesting your quant ideas, and only if you\'re going to ultra high frequency trading would you then port your well-tested ideas into C++.\n\nSource: MSc in Computer Science; High performance programming experience in C++, scientific programming experience in Python from my PhD in Physics, some financial applications programming experience in Python from my job.

Octave is similar to Matlab but free.  \n  \nI've seen several online comparisons saying that (Matlab/Octave) language is slower (execution time) than R and R is slower than Python.  Those are total BS.  For ordinary code that doesn't use large matrix operations, Matlab is about the same execution speed as Python.  For matrix operations, Matlab is much faster than Python.  \n  \nC++ is certainly not old in the sense that anything could replace it.  But it is a difficult language to learn and difficult (compared to languages like Python and Java) for non experts to use well, and its overwhelming advantages in giant projects and in some very speed critical projects, are likely irrelevant in what you want to do.  \n  \nPython is the clear choice for your purpose among those you listed.  \n  \nI personally find any project type easier to code in C++ rather than Python.  But that is because of many years experience using the advanced features of C++ (that most C++ software engineers never learn).  But I do some of my work in Python because the rest of the team I'm in now doesn't know any C++.  The best programming language for most tasks is the one **you** know best.  So if you left out already knowing a programming language that would change the answer.  \n  \nIf you take my advice and choose Octave, I strongly suggest using online documentation of Matlab to guide your programming in Octave.

The larger the scale of the fund, the more buying power, fees, income, securities lending, etc it can utilize to cut its expense ratio. \n\n\nOne last comment is that some funds stop contributions b/c there can be a point where too much capital is flowing into the fund and it’s difficult for the fund to appropriately allocate that money based upon the ‘theme’ of the index. The fund manager may stop contributions for this reason. That’s a concern for some of vg’s other funds, but very small for the total stock market index. ', ""I suspect one major reason is because the funds own Vanguard, and Vanguard itself has a mission of operating at-cost.

WFC04-13,8b0n07,This is the week for gains in the financial sector. DD inside. (x-post to r/wsb),1523297810.0,1,0,"TL;DR: I think there is strong possibility of strong gains to be had this week in the financial sector. Buy in by COB Wednesday to take advantage, and exploit using $XLF options or $FAS.

Thesis: The financial sector is one of the most undervalued in the market right now, and as earnings season begins I expect the market to finally give the sector the attention it deserves. Reasons:

1. The financial sector is tremendously undervalued right now when you [simply look at ratios](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true). At 18.3, the financial sector currently has a P/E ratio that is not only the lowest in the S&P 500, but [is in line with historical P/E ratios](http://www.multpl.com/), unlike many sectors right now. 
2. Earnings should be strong for a couple reasons. One of these reasons is that net interest margins, the difference between the interest a bank pays and the interest it receives, [has been expanding](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/jpmorgan-citigroup-wells-fargo-and-pnc-financial-are-part-of-zacks-earnings-preview-cm945379), possibly more than analysts have been expecting.
3. Another reason to expect strong earnings is strong economic fundamentals. The market has had ADHD recently with concerns about tariffs, $FB data usage, Trump tweets about $AMZN, and so on. Investors have lost sight of the fact that the economy is pretty strong right now, but earnings season will remind them of that. We have great job numbers, rising household incomes, high consumer confidence, and so on. These are conditions that lead to high use of the financial sector among both consumers and industry.
4. Another reason for strong earnings is this is the first quarter of earnings after tax reform. Enough said.
5. FAANG may finally be becoming passe. I realize as I am typing this that $NFLX is up 3.5% today (though on low volume) even though it has a P/E ratio around 232, but the market seems a bit more skittish around tech ever since the Cambridge Analytica news came out. Retail investors are being dumb and buying the bubble, but [big investors are very short on tech right now](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/04/09/hedge-funds-turn-bearish-on-tech-giants/). (If you don't have access for WSJ stop being a pleb. Ask mom to buy you a few less tendies this week and get you a WSJ sub instead) [Valuations for tech right now are insane](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true), and buying in right now seems to be typical WSB buy high sell low autism.
6. This week kicks off earnings season. On Thursday, [$OZRK and $CBSH announce premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-12). On Friday, [$C, $FHN, $FRC, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC are all announcing premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-13). All of these are forecast to have improved YOY EPS, and some of them significantly so. P/E ratios for these are respectively: 14.14, 20.62, none, 27.41, 21.09, 17.86, 14.57, and 13.06.
More importantly, one year forward P/E ratios for these are respectively: 12.65, 17.49, 10.72, 13.08, 18.87, 12.27, 14.04, and 11.14. These valuations are as close as you can get to a steal in this market.



How to exploit:

1. Trade $XLF. It's a high volume ETF that tracks the financial sector of the S&P 500. Of the banks announcing earnings this week, its holdings include $C, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC. I would expect good results among these banks to raise share prices among the rest of the holdings of $XLF. Simply buying $XLF is the safe play.
2. Buy calls in $XLF. Pretty straightforward.
3. Buy $FAS.This is a 3x leveraged ETF tracking the financial sector. It tracks all of the banks announcing earnings this week, among others.

PNC04-13,8azuz6,Money market funds now paying 1.75%+ interest,1523292041.0,78,138,"Banks have been very slow to increase interest on savings accounts. Many large banks still have the nerve to pay no interest. A quick check shows that in my zip code, BoA, PNC, and Wells Fargo each pay 0.01% to 0.03% interest on their basic savings accounts. If you jump through hoops by having a checking account with them and meeting account minimums, hopefully avoiding the $5-$12 account service fee, they pay a whopping 0.06%, 0.10%, and 0.32% interest, respectively. Even bank money market savings accounts pay very little interest, at 0.03% with PNC Bank. Unless you're with an online bank like Ally, a credit union, or another bank that is particularly aggressive about their savings account interest rate, you're probably getting ripped off.

Vanguard's prime money market fund pays 1.74% interest currently with no account service fee, although given, it does require a minimum of $3000 to start. But if you already have investments with vanguard or another mutual fund company, it's a no brainier to use their money market fund as your savings account rather than your bank savings account. I keep a $100 cash buffer in my checking account, credit cards for emergencies, and then my savings are in Vanguard's prime money market fund beside my taxable investment and retirement accounts.

I just wanted to point this out since it feels like increasing mutual fund money market rates have flown under the radar. It's kind of upsetting to me because I feel like people are getting robbed. Meanwhile, mutual fund money market accounts could be paying 2.5% interest by year end, with essentially no risk to principal.

PNC04-13,8b0n07,This is the week for gains in the financial sector. DD inside. (x-post to r/wsb),1523297810.0,1,0,"TL;DR: I think there is strong possibility of strong gains to be had this week in the financial sector. Buy in by COB Wednesday to take advantage, and exploit using $XLF options or $FAS.

Thesis: The financial sector is one of the most undervalued in the market right now, and as earnings season begins I expect the market to finally give the sector the attention it deserves. Reasons:

1. The financial sector is tremendously undervalued right now when you [simply look at ratios](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true). At 18.3, the financial sector currently has a P/E ratio that is not only the lowest in the S&P 500, but [is in line with historical P/E ratios](http://www.multpl.com/), unlike many sectors right now. 
2. Earnings should be strong for a couple reasons. One of these reasons is that net interest margins, the difference between the interest a bank pays and the interest it receives, [has been expanding](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/jpmorgan-citigroup-wells-fargo-and-pnc-financial-are-part-of-zacks-earnings-preview-cm945379), possibly more than analysts have been expecting.
3. Another reason to expect strong earnings is strong economic fundamentals. The market has had ADHD recently with concerns about tariffs, $FB data usage, Trump tweets about $AMZN, and so on. Investors have lost sight of the fact that the economy is pretty strong right now, but earnings season will remind them of that. We have great job numbers, rising household incomes, high consumer confidence, and so on. These are conditions that lead to high use of the financial sector among both consumers and industry.
4. Another reason for strong earnings is this is the first quarter of earnings after tax reform. Enough said.
5. FAANG may finally be becoming passe. I realize as I am typing this that $NFLX is up 3.5% today (though on low volume) even though it has a P/E ratio around 232, but the market seems a bit more skittish around tech ever since the Cambridge Analytica news came out. Retail investors are being dumb and buying the bubble, but [big investors are very short on tech right now](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/04/09/hedge-funds-turn-bearish-on-tech-giants/). (If you don't have access for WSJ stop being a pleb. Ask mom to buy you a few less tendies this week and get you a WSJ sub instead) [Valuations for tech right now are insane](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true), and buying in right now seems to be typical WSB buy high sell low autism.
6. This week kicks off earnings season. On Thursday, [$OZRK and $CBSH announce premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-12). On Friday, [$C, $FHN, $FRC, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC are all announcing premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-13). All of these are forecast to have improved YOY EPS, and some of them significantly so. P/E ratios for these are respectively: 14.14, 20.62, none, 27.41, 21.09, 17.86, 14.57, and 13.06.
More importantly, one year forward P/E ratios for these are respectively: 12.65, 17.49, 10.72, 13.08, 18.87, 12.27, 14.04, and 11.14. These valuations are as close as you can get to a steal in this market.



How to exploit:

1. Trade $XLF. It's a high volume ETF that tracks the financial sector of the S&P 500. Of the banks announcing earnings this week, its holdings include $C, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC. I would expect good results among these banks to raise share prices among the rest of the holdings of $XLF. Simply buying $XLF is the safe play.
2. Buy calls in $XLF. Pretty straightforward.
3. Buy $FAS.This is a 3x leveraged ETF tracking the financial sector. It tracks all of the banks announcing earnings this week, among others. It has average volume of around 2.3 million shares per day at a price of around $65, so it's big enough that liquidity won't be an issue. This is what I'm doing.
4. Buy calls in $FAS. This is only for those who play Russian roulette for fun. DON'T DO THIS.

UNH04-17,87j51j,My portfolio hit 500k!,1522163231.0,467,1482,"My goal is to retire early so it's nice to hit this milestone early on in my career.

I'm 33 and just about to celebrate my 10 year anniversary of being employed. Plan is to retire around 40-45 and then focus on my hobbies. 

I don't bring in a ridiculous salary but have had a high savings rate and good luck with returns. I'm frugal so I can maintain a decent savings rate despite living in a relatively expensive northeast suburb. My rent is $1850 as an example although I split that cost with my Fiancee. 

According to the ss.gov website, my gross income average since I started working has been $70254. I started at $45,000 when I graduated in 2008. It's doubled since then and now I can finally pump more money into individual accounts. It's pretty awesome to have a portfolio that's probably equal to my actual net income after taxes. The power of compounding!

I max out the 401k and Roth IRA each year with index funds. Index funds make up about 65% of my investment income and the rest is individual securities. I've had a great run with some individual picks that have driven results quite a bit(UNH, MKL are my two biggest holdings and I bought a bunch of UNH in the 20s all the way up to the 100s). I actually sold a bunch of UNH when it became too big a part of my portfolio in the 130s and now it soared all the way up to 220. Risk management can sometimes come at the expense of returns but I'd rather not how so much exposure to one stock. Still hold a good portion of their stock though and like the company. I've also played around with options a bit but in a very small way. Again most of my money is in index funds so my overall returns haven't been that far above the S&P 500 although I've eclipsed it a little bit. 

My strategy has been to follow a strict investment plan since I started although I only got serious about tracking my asset allocation closely in the past few years. My investment plan also allows me to hold up to 10% max in cash as part of my portfolio when I can't find any good deals out there. I always have money flowing into the market though via bi weekly 401k contributions. 

I'm pretty amped to get there so early due to the crazy bull market we've had and am not worried if there's a move in the other direction. I'm still likely 10+ years out and plan to keep pumping money in for a while so lower prices are better for me from a long term return perspective. 

Just wanted to say YAY and show everyone that it doesn't take a ton to make things work as long as you're consistent.

GS04-17,8duepb,"""Iraqi"" hacker targeted US Hedge Fund known for shorting and publishing reports on fraudulent Chinese companies.",1524297270.0,5,5,"So this is interesting.  [Muddy Waters Research](https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/987546286210535424) headed by Carson Block has just had its website taken down by a group apparently claiming 'Shia Iraqi' allegiance.  ([""hacked by SaTtAr_iQ""](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&ei=6-TaWvC-DsSg0wKvs4KADA&q=%22HaCKeD+by+SaTtAr+iQ%22+&oq=%22HaCKeD+by+SaTtAr+iQ%22+&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160k1l2.43488.43488.0.43764.1.1.0.0.0.0.202.202.2-1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.202....0.IAi9X2KMWE0), whose twitter profile says 'professional security', Iraq.)

A few months before in December they'd just published a rather long (and fairly well written, shame I didn't save it) report on [CIFS](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cifs) currently trading on the NYSE.

Since that report came out CIFS's stock has taken a pretty heavy blow. (From 1.3B to 500M today)  This weeks ago, however, CIFS stopped a long run of bleeding losses a week after they claimed they'd [investigate](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/china-internet-nationwide-financial-services-inc-comments-on-recent-stock-price-movement-20180410-01239).

And then all of the sudden the MW website is taken down by an ""Iraqi"" hacker.

That... kinda implies a lot.  Is this normal?  Do 'hackers' often target research firms like that?  I haven't heard of it before, let alone stumble upon it myself.

Also, doesn't this kinda imply that shorting the stock is a good idea?  Wouldn't this be the kind of action to backfire spectacularly? 

I'm assuming, of course, that an Iraqi hacker has no interest in targeting a US hedge fund known mostly for shorting Chinese companies and from what I could tell (the site was working last night) had never mentioned a single middle eastern company.

Though there appears to be a group of hackers known as [MuddyWaters](https://www.cyberscoop.com/muddywaters-trend-micro-middle-east/) that appears to be Iranian based.  Which... I think is a coincidence but a profoundly weird one, especially given the [Chinese parts that were seen as false flags](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/campaign-possibly-connected-muddywater-surfaces-middle-east-central-asia/).  (""MuddyWaters"" is referencing a [*Chinese*](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=http://chengyu.t086.com/&prev=search) proverb no less)

Honestly, I don't know what to make of it.  Just think the entire thing is kinda hilarious and absurd in its own way.  At least I would if I didn't find it a bit scary that the Chinese government would pretend to be middle eastern hackers to shut down US websites spreading information about fraud.  Kinda has bad implications. 

Is this kind of stuff normal?  Has anyone else ever stumbled on something like that?

Technology -

Microsoft (MSFT): Stable growth over the past thirty something years, constantly competes with Apple and Google for market share. 

Google (GOOGL): Similarly, Google has held a large portion of the tech market along with making insane profits annually. As an added benefit, it has steadily grown and the only thing I can think of that's negative is the YouTube bots fiasco. 

Tesla (TSLA): This just out of fanboyism, I love Elon Musk. He's awesome. And, anyway, Tesla does civilian and governmental contracting, e.g selling cars to the public and solar panels to the government, etc. 

Gaming and eSports:

Activision Blizzard (ATVI): The world's leading video game publisher, also owns Overwatch of which I, and others, love. 

Riot Games (HKG: 0700): League of Legends is consistently one of the most watched game on Twitch and the tournaments for the game net millions. The industry can only grow too, us kids aren't just going to stop playing.

Boeing (BA): Boeing is an unstoppable juggernaut. Airlines love them, people love them, and countries love them. They sell airplanes, rockets, satellites, all the cool stuff, and they own a huge percent of the aeronautics industry. They're unstoppable!

Pharmaceuticals:

AbbVie Inc (ABBV): Will eclipse $35bn by 2025, and, like JNJ, pays out good dividends. Revenue is growing very fast, with Wall Street believing ABBV will have a 16% annualized profit growth each year for the next five. That's pretty fast. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): While it did lose profit by losing its patent protection, it recently launched two new megablockbuster drugs of which are offsetting these losses. Might be fun to see how this stock does. 

Johnson and Johnson (JNJ): One of the best healthcare stocks, JNJ is growing faster than any other pharma corp and it yields an awesome dividend. 

Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND): Is a fast growing pharma corp that has a $2.9bn mid cap. Will also be interesting to see where this one goes. 

Index Funds:

Fidelity MSCI information Tech (FTEC): 27.49% annual returns according to USA News, and has $1.88bn worth of assets. 

Vanguard Information Technology (VGT): 27.5% annual returns, also according to USA News, and has $20.05bn worth of assets. 

Wall Street Bets:

Micron Techonology (MU): The stock goes up and down, up and down, just like my portfolio!

Nvidia (NVDA): Same reason as Micron. 

AMD (AMD): I'm an autist, alright? Leave me alone. 

Outside of stocks, I'd probably invest in some real estate in Delhi, Shanghai and/or Tokyo. Also, obviously, I'm joking about the r/wsb stuff. Anyways, what companies would you invest in? Why?

USB04-18,8apw3s,6 great stories this week you should be aware of,1523193771.0,18,53,"All feedback and comments very welcome

**Value Stocks**
Good article in Seeking Alpha this week on New York & Co (NWY - New York & Company Is Worth $4 Per Share).  The stock is trading on a EV/EBITDA ratio of 5.  Not bad for a company that just reported 3% comp growth and guided for 23% EBITDA growth in H1 2018.

In Fool.com on Tuesday there was a write up about the three top retail stocks.  The first company covered was The Michaels Companies (MIK).  As an arts & craft retailer it faces less competition than most from Amazon and is growing rapidly with Q4 samestore sales increasing 2.5%, net sales 8% and adjusted EPS up 16%. The 5 year consensus is for EPS growth of 11% but thats done little for the stock which trades on a trailing twelve month PE of just 9.1


**Insider Buying**
On Thursday Nasdaq.com reported Whitehorse Financial (WHF) Chairman John Bolduc bought $90k of stock April 2nd in his fifth purchase in two years.  It’s a vote of confidence in Whitehorse which makes private loans to companies and has seen earnings rise 50% in three years yet trades on a PE of 7.1 and yields 11%.(Beware this is a microcap with high risk)


**Special Situations**
On Wednesday Marcello Pinto wrote in Seeking Alpha that Monsanto (MON) looks cheap whether the planned Bayer acquisition goes ahead or not. Completion of the acquisition yields a 9% return while downside appears minimal given stock is trading on 22 times trailing earnings compared to a historic average of 25. Restoring the multiple of 25 times 2018 estimates would increase the stock price by about 20%


**Dividend**
Umpqua Bank (UMPQ) believes it is the best bank in the world.  Apparently they say so when they answer the phone.  There's no doubt its a well run bank with excellent credit quality and an outstanding service level that yields a significant competitive advantage.  But best of all it has a 4% dividend. Seeking Alpha article by Herding Value on Tuesday 

**Growth Stock**
Cypress Semiconductor (CY) looks like growth at a reasonable price as market leader in IoT, SRAM memory chips, USB-C controllers, and other USB solutions.  Analysts expect 37% earnings growth this year while the trailing PE is a reasonable 20.  Fool article on Monday “3 Top Value Stocks to Buy in April”.

URI04-19,8e2n9n,4 interesting long opportunities that you should know about,1524395841.0,2,0,"United Rentals (URI), Sabre Corporation (SABR), Criteo (CRTO) and Royal Caribbean (RCL)

**United Rentals** (URI) operates in a cyclical industry with a volatile stock price but with a CAGR of 23% for earnings over the the past 5 years investors have been well rewarded.  Looking ahead the outlook remains bright.  The Purchasing Managers Index at 59% remains very optimistic about future growth.  Thats up from 55% a year ago with any result above 50% being a bullish forward indicator.  Long term trends for the industry are positive as companies realize the significant benefits from renting over ownership.  Additionally, as market leader URI enjoys significant economies of scale but with a market share of just 11% it still has a long runway for growth.  Trading on a multiple of 11 times consensus 2018 earnings it looks cheap. 


**Sabre Corporation** (SABR) is a travel technology company, the biggest service provider for air bookings in North America and connects the worlds leading hotels, car rental brands, rail carriers, cruise lines and tour operator with travel buyers.  That's a fast growing business with significant barriers to entry in the airlines solutions while hospitality is competitive.  The stock has fallen 33% over the past 2 years and trades on a TTM PE of 12.  However, Imperial Capital initiated coverage this week with a target price of $30 representing a 50% increase over Fridays close. With consensus 2020 earnings of $1.91 that looks quite reasonable.


With the stock down 50% and a forward 2018 PE of 12 **Criteo** (CRTO) looks cheap again. The company is a leading advertising company in the digital market space that hit problems last year when Apple blocked it from Safari browser users.  However the company has got over it with Q4 number report sales up 23% and earnings up 30%. With the stock down 50% and a forward 2018 PE of 12 it looks cheap again.

Finally Cruise Lines such as **Royal Caribbean** have had a great run with the stock rising more than threefold and EPS growing by 55% CAGR over the past 5 years.  Numerous tailwinds continue to boost the outlook with an aging population, strong growth in China and tax benefits in the US likely to provide a boost.  Earnings growth is likely to moderate going forward with consensus forecasts suggesting 15% annual growth.  With a 2018 forward PE of 13.6 the stock looks cheap at $119.00.  Stifel Nicolaus recently issued at $152.00 target price citing an expected positive revision to summer and full year guidance.  With reporting expected in the next couple of weeks investors may want to take a look.

MS04-18,86m9e8,Change my view: Dropbox is not worth 10b,1521824663.0,78,118,"The recent price jump after the IPO to about USD 30 means the company has a market cap of around 10 billion. IMHO, the company doesnt offer much value in the long-term as an independent company. 

The company is currently not profitable: Net Income of around -110m, profit margin of around -10%

The company is a one-trick-pony: since it's founding about 10y ago, the company only offers one service, file storage solutions.

The product is not really unique: I don't see a requirement that Dropbox meets that Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, etc. do not also meet.

The company's competitors have deep pockets: Amazon (drive), Google (Drive), Microsoft (OneDrive) have much deeper war chests than Dropbox

The company's competitors have eco-systems that they can leverage when positioning their cloud storage solutions: Amazon bundles their cloud storage to Amazon Prime, Microsoft can integrate MS Office well into OneDrive, etc.

I would very much like to hear differing opinions that outline how and why Dropbox will become profitable and why it should be worth 10b or even more today.",0.87,"[""Here's the counterargument:\n\nCurrently, Dropbox is currently earning ~$1.1 billion of revenue on 11 million paying users. Growth is ~30% year over year. Incremental margins are nearly 70%. \n\nSo in 3 years, if Dropbox can continue to grow at 30% per year and double paying users to 22 million while keeping pricing constant, revenue will reach $2.4 billion. EBITDA will increase 70%*$1.1 billion, so $770 million, fromn $68 million today to ~$830mm in 3 years. \n\nSo a $10 billion valuation is an 12x EBITDA multiple on a company growing at 30% 3 years from now. Capex is $25mm a year, D&A is $180mm, taxes are 20%, so net income is $525mm (19x P/E multiple) and cash flow is more like $670mm (15x FCF multiple, or a 6.7% yield). That's ignoring any future growth, too. How much would you pay for that? It depends on your cost of capital, but paying $10 billion for a business like that in 3 years seems like a relatively decently value play.\n\nYou can argue that the growth will slow down, but I don't yet see evidence of that, and given the penetration of Dropbox paying users, it doesn't seem like it has to either. Nor does Dropbox really need massive growth - just enough so that they can get value out of their massive incremental margins. \n\nAgain, there's a lot to quibble with here, but that's the basic math that the market is doing. You don't need extreme assumptions to make this look like an attractive investment. Just get 11 million more paying users (increase conversion 2% off of the existing 500 million user base, or increase that base) and have high incremental margins. Sure, an investor could lose a lot because of competition here, but you also might gain a lot if a small minority of people decide to use Dropbox instead. Dropbox doesn't need to beat it's competition for everyone, just for a small minority of people."", ""IPO, It's Probably Overpriced"", ""Dropbox's software is just better and business/pro users will pay for quality that works simply\n\nAll the competitors are actually cheaper than Dropbox, but tons of people are still paying for it...many of which are new customers. Look at pilord's comment on Dropbox's growth and I'm just talking about why the growth actually makes sense.\n\nJust try out GDrive/One Drive/Amazon Drive/Dropbox all together and just compare their desktop syncing software.\n\nDropbox has the slickest integration and the best performance for what I do. One thing I see onedrive do is it doesn't know how to efficiently upload changes...so if you one make one tiny change in a 100MB file OneDrive uploads the whole file again.\n\n\nDropbox's features (and simplicity/usability) for business users also look slick, though I don't have access to that anymore.  \n\nThat said, it DOES seem like the competitors could start to catch up...but they've had years and they still suck in comparison. I think the difference might be that while to MS/AMZ/GOOG owning this file sync and stoage space is just a small part of their company that'll never be their #1 priority, while Dropbox always puts their A team and their best effort into making this just work.\n\nAnecdotally, I hear MS only has ~50 people working on the whole onedrive syncing infrastructure, while Dropbox has 800+ engineers who probably mostly work on this.\n\nAnother anecdote: Dropbox's newish SVP of Engineering is getting ~30-50million in stock compensation.  I really don't think the competitors are paying out that much to the head of just OneDrive/GDrive/AmazonDrive engineering. Dropbox is smaller, but they're pouring more money into this specific problem. (and hopefully this dude is actually worth the cost..but we'll see)\n\nSo overall...still not sure about 10B, but I do think you're overstating the risk from competitors.  It'll be very telling to see their quarterly earning growth reports.\n\n"", ""Believe it or not, people at my company are too dumb to use the onedrive that comes with our office365 subscription and we pay for dropbox as well. Not really much of an argument but it's something to consider. Sometimes people don't want to deal with more functions and just want 1 thing done in a way that is easy for them. "", ""I don't really have a strong opinion on Dropbox, so I'm only using this as an exercise to argue why Dropbox might be worth $10 billion.\n\n1. The most simple argument is that the market says it's worth that much. Investors are voting with their dollars, and whatever your opinion is doesn't change the fact that people are putting their money on this being the correct valuation.\n2. Dropbox users are probably not going to be switching away from dropbox. I personally use onedrive, and I have absolutely no reason to switch, because I have a place where I can put files and get files on the cloud. I'm sure that dropbox users feel the same way.\n3. The competitors with deep pockets could potentially add lots of features to try to woo customers, but they could also just *buy out dropbox*. At $10 billion, all of the competitors you listed could *easily* make the purchase with cash, today. Alphabet or Microsoft could do it with less than 10% of their cash on hand."", ""The only offer one service, and I love it (business user). So what? Ferrari only sells cars, so what?\n\nYou list off a bunch of competitors that should have killed them, and yet they're still here after 10 years.

It will be interesting to see how going public changes things.\n\nLong GOOGL, no position on Dropbox. "", ""As someone who believes in Dropbox, I agree its overpriced. I've been using Dropbox since its inception and now I'm a paid user. Google Drive and One Drive always struck me as clunky, poorer Dropbox clones and never got it right. The Dropbox client's native integration always worked amazingly well too (I've used it on Windows, Mac and Linux). \n\nWith all that said, no way its worth $10 billion. I'll wait for the price to drop to something more reasonable. Look at Box's IPO, it was overpriced from the start. "", 'I agree with you. ', 'Google Drive.

With Dropbox I can just drop an item into the folder and forget about it. \n\nI don’t see drive and iCloud getting better. These companies have so much more to worry about. Yes they have teams dedicated to these things but thats not their primary business. \n\nThis is what Dropbox does. This is their primary business. Backup and sync. They have one product and they’ve nailed it. If they don’t keep it up, they go bout of business. \n\nSo, I will continue to shell out $9.99 a month.

In the early days of word processing, a spell checker was a separate piece of software developed by a 3rd party.  Eventually they got folded into the core apps for which they were intended and spell check companies either got bought or closed up.  The same will happen with cloud storage.  Thus, I'm bearish on the future of Dropbox.  \n\nOne thing I've not seen mentioned so far (to be fair: skimmed) is that generally speaking, DB is 'owned' by the user.  OneDrive, through O365 for business, is 'owned' by the business.  If I change your password or disable your account, you've also lost access to your OneDrive.  If I do a site-wide content search, Sharepoint and OneDrive are searched as well.  I can set features like a 'hold' whereby regardless of your actions, files aren't really deleted.  I can audit your activity and see if you've been sending files to a 3rd party account, and what account that is.  Just a few examples.\n\nMS O365 is free to students and .edus.  MS is doing what Apple did in the 80s and giving away tons of tech and software (like MS Imagine/Dreamspark, which basically makes all their STEM stuff free). Among this, they give students 1 terabyte of free storage on dropbox.  \n\nAdditionally, Microsoft, in their usual fashion, will introduce features into Windows which simply won't play well with Dropbox, in order to slowly muscle them off the platform.  \n\nAll in all, the landscape is shifting under dropbox pretty rapidly."", ""It's trading on technicals/hysteria/whatever more than fundamentals right now.

MS04-18,884jcl,Why are people so quick to recommend against waiting to invest at the time of the next bear market/large dip/recession/correction?,1522354467.0,38,13,"All over the internet and especially in places like /r/investing etc people repeat the term: ""Time in the market beats timing the market"", ""nobody can predict the market"", etc etc. I'm not saying these views are necessarily *wrong*. But they aren't right either. If I'm wrong, feel free to explain to me but I just don't see it.

I've made a crappy table on MS paint to show my point: https://i.imgur.com/qOrKolQ.png

Now I'm making a couple of assumptions here which follow:

1. Most importantly, I'm referring to short/medium term investment into a well diversified fund such as an index fund. (Here I use the SP500 index). Of course, if you leave your money in the market for 20, 30 or 40 years, as in retirement accounts, historical data shows you would almost certainly have a positive ROI. So this doesn't apply to investment over a lifetime.

2. The objective of investing is to buy securities low, get a positive ROI and sell higher than you bought, to receive a profit. I think its safe to say this is what almost everyone is after.

3. Nobody can know the highest point of a peak or lower point of a dip, however I am referring to purchasing once it is clear that the market is dropping, not specifically at the lowest point of the dip; and selling when the market has recovered overall, not right before the next dip. For most of my examples I use a 5 year period.

4. When I say words such as ""recession"" I am not using the terms per textbook definition. I understand a recession has specific characteristics which classify it as such; however I use the word as most people in the world use it - a time when the market drops, confidence is low, companies fail, people lose their job etc. Let's not get terribly technical. 

5. That the market will always recover and continue to go higher as time goes on. This is the concept the entire retirement investment concept is based on. so when we buy at the dip, we suppose the market will recover some time soon.

6. The market is cyclical and even thought we hope it will continue to rise overall, recessions happen at an almost stupidly easy to predict rate.

- In scenario 1, we suppose we purchased shares right at the peak of the 2000 bull market. Exactly 5 years later, we happen to need cash and so liquidate at a loss for a return of -16.05%. We bought high in a good market and sold low. Now you could keep your shares and wait until the market turns around; however even if you waited until the peak of the recovered market around July of 2007 (and you'd have to be really lucky to guess that exact point), you would only make a 5% positive ROI, over SEVEN years of ownership. 

- In scenario 2, we purchased shares at the very tip of the ""recession"" in October 2002 when it was clear to everyone that the market was at a decline. 5 years later, we decide to sell to realize our gains and make a 51.57% ROI. This is 67.62% more than the guy who bought the Dot Com peak in scenario 1; and 46.57% more than even if that guy had waited until the very tip of the 2007 peak who also owned his shares for 2 more years than scenario 2 guy.

- In scenario 3, we take a more realistic approach as we do not know exactly when the peaks and valleys are. We buy in February 2007 right before the recession because ""people predicted 9 of the last 5 recessions"" and ""time in the market etc"". 5 years later we need to liquidate and sell at a loss for a -4.87% ROI. 

- In scenario 4, we kept our cash until the housing bubble burst and the recession was underway. Everyone's freaking out and we purchase in October 2008 because we think its the lowest it will go. Obviously it doesn't, it kept getting lower. however, that is what most likely would happen as nobody knows where the bottom is; but its obviously a recession and it'll have to go up soon. Turns out we were right and a little less than 5 years later we decide to realize our profit and sell for a 41.02% ROI.  You made 45.89% more than the guy in scenario 3 simply by waiting one year until the market was obviously at a low and stocks were at price/undervalued. 

Now you might be saying: ""but Nakuke, if scenario 3 guy had simply waited until today and the crazy bull market of 2017, he would have made a lot of money! Stay long! HODL!"" You're right, and we'll address that in the last 2 scenarios.

- In scenario 5, we buy in November 2006 while the market is still rising, and we're even willing to hold medium-term for over 10 years (12 to be precise). On In March 2018 we decide that the market is too crazy with the tariff business, Amazon regulation etc etc. we decide to sell and take your profit. We made almost double at a 91.26% ROI. Sounds good right? Except it could have been better and almost guaranteed a return if we simply waited 2 years until the market went to crap. This is next.

- In scenario 6, we decided to save our cash and buy in in the middle of the recession, not even the bottom of it. We stayed almost equally as long as scenario 5 guy, holding for almost 10 years until March 2018 when the market starts going bonkers and we decide to GTFO to secure our profit. We almost quadruple our investment for a 173.06% ROI. We made 81.8% more than scenario 5 guy by simply waiting to buy during the recession (waiting/saving cash for 2 years). We probably were able to invest even more than our scenario 5 self because we had 2 years to save more money in cash before using it to buy shares of the index. There was also no point during the period where the market took a dip large enough to give us a loss, and there was no point where it was very clear that the market would start to decline into the next (inevitable) recession, except maybe 2015; in which case you still would have beat scenario 5 guy if you sold out of fear.

**Why I'm writing this**:

I am not some sort of investing guru, in fact I started to invest (a small amount) money into the market in January of this year; which was pretty crap luck for me and others who did so. the last 5 years or so have been nothing but growth and rise, and now this year the market's doing weird things nobody understands due to new loss of confidence in the market and unfavorable conditions (tariffs etc) The last 4 recessions took place almost exactly 10 years apart: 1981, 1990, 2001, and 2007/8. If this continues, its reasonable to believe the next recession/dip etc will take place some time this or next year. We may even be ""overdue"". The price of most stocks, particularly tech and meme stocks (AMZN, NFLX, etc) have risen dramatically since the last recession and I don't think its irrational to say many of them, and the market overall, is overvalued. Buying into the market now is the perfect example of ""Buying high"" which makes it much more likely you will sell low unless you're ready to wait 10-20 years to make a profit - in which case you may as well just put your money in your 401k/IRA; or simply keep your money - the opportunity cost of waiting 10-20 or more years to even double your investment, at least for me, is too great. Giving up a dollar I can use today to make another dollar to use in 20 years is a waste.

In the past 2 months the value of my investment has dropped around 8% and its not a huge deal as its a small amount of play money (1000 USD); but it made me think and come to this conclusion. Stocks are at an all time high right now. I'm literally buying shares the their most expensive price in history. I'd have to wait a long time for the next all time high to make a relatively small profit. Instead if I hold my cash and wait for the market to drop - which it more than likely will sooner than later as history has shown time and time again, I can almost guarantee myself a profit in a shorter period of time. That is precisely what I have decided to do. I sold my small investment for the 8% loss and put y money back into a high-interest savings account with the rest of my cash. I'll continue to save for 1 or 2 years when I very strongly believe the market will be at a lower point than it is now. Then I'll buy a much larger number of shares low, wait for the recovery, and sell high. It's ""timing the market"" but it's not exactly rocket science. Just BL,SH. This does NOT apply to my TSP account. I've started to invest in my TSP each month in equal amounts regardless of market performance as I will not use the money until retirement time or at least until 30 years or more from now. Although I COULD make more money by putting in a lump sum during a recession, its easier and more disciplined to simply save the same amount each paycheck - the length of time is so large that it makes the difference in profit pretty small.

However I hope this can give people a perspective before they spout buzz phrases like ""Time in the market beats timing the market"", ""ALWAYS buy and hold, start now!"", ""Insert Warren Buffet/Lynch quote here"" regardless of whether the market at the time of the question is at an all time high and likely to turn around sooner than later.",0.65,"['>Instead if I hold my cash and wait for the market to drop - which it more than likely will sooner than later as history has shown time and time again, I can almost guarantee myself a profit in a shorter period of time. \n\nAre you going to set some criteria for this?

>Mattel Inc. MAT Chief Executive Margaret “Margo” Georgiadis is in discussions to leave the toy maker, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be an abrupt exit at a company struggling with slumping sales and in the midst of a restructuring.

>The former Google executive, who joined Mattel in February 2017, has been unable to reverse the Barbie doll and Hot Wheels maker’s fortunes. She has overhauled Mattel’s management team, suspended its dividend and unveiled plans to slash $650 million in costs.

>Details of her potential departure, such as who might replace her, couldn’t be learned. Last month, the company said it would elevate director Ynon Kreiz, a former studio executive who joined the board last year, to the role of executive chairman.

>Mattel shares have fallen nearly 50% since Ms. Georgiadis took over, chopping its market value to just under $5 billion. The company’s annual sales have slipped below those of rival Hasbro Inc., which The Wall Street Journal reported last fall was exploring a potential takeover. It is unclear where those discussions currently stand.

>Mattel, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., and has 28,000 employees, has cycled through several leaders in recent years. A new CEO would be the fourth in four years. Like her predecessor, Ms. Georgiadis didn’t have experience in the toy business before taking the job.

>Ms. Georgiadis was recruited to join the toy maker in late 2016, as Mattel was signaling confidence in the looming holiday season. But Mattel’s inventories piled up at retailers and didn’t sell as expected, and the company had to cut prices to try to salvage the most critical period in the year. Sales and profits plunged as a result.

>Instead of inheriting a company on the upswing, by the time she joined after the holidays, Ms. Georgiadis found herself trying to stabilize what was then the world’s largest toy company.

>She continued to uncover more problems at Mattel. Before she arrived, Mattel leadership was trying to recoup more than $400 million in sales it lost when Hasbro took over a major Walt Disney Co. license tied to the “Frozen” movie and other princess dolls. But the slew of smaller products it turned to in an effort to close the gap added complexity and costs, and didn’t have lasting power. Some of Mattel’s other brands, like Monster High and American Girl, also slumped.

>Mattel continued to struggle last year as it tried to reduce excess inventory at retail and had to cope with the bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys “R” Us Inc., one of its biggest sales channels. Mattel’s sales fell 11% last year, its fourth-straight year of declines. The company reports its latest quarterly results next week.

> PG&E Corp. has been losing customers in tony Marin County north of San Francisco since 2010 to a new kind of rival, and says their growing popularity is costing the utility’s remaining customers, to the tune of $180 million last year. That could balloon to $500 million in the early 2020s, according to a statement Tuesday.

> California’s big three utilities are looking for ways to address this emerging issue. They helped make the state a clean-energy leader by striking some of the first big deals to buy wind and solar power. Problem is, those early contracts came with higher prices that were typically locked in for decades, and it’s costing them customers.

> The utilities are facing smaller local suppliers that are signing their own power-purchase deals at current, lower rates, and then siphoning off customers by passing on the discounts. At least 4.5 million California homes and businesses will be getting electricity from them by yearend, according to the California Community Choice Association, which represents these new power companies.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-proposes-reforms-support-160000811.html

> Also in 2002, California’s legislature authorized the formation of CCAs, allowing cities and counties to purchase and/or generate electricity for their residents and businesses. The first CCA began in PG&E’s service area in 2010. Likewise, customers can choose to receive their electricity from other third-party suppliers called Energy Service Providers (ESPs). For both CCA and ESP customers, PG&E continues to deliver the energy and provide meter reading, billing, maintenance and emergency response services.

> Today, communities that choose to implement CCA programs or customers that choose ESPs are responsible for the PCIA charge associated with energy resources procured on their behalf. PG&E does not make any money on the PCIA. The PCIA charge is required to ensure that all customers are treated equally and do not pay for other customers’ share of costs.

> However, the current PCIA formula has become unbalanced over time due to the growth of CCAs. **In 2017, CCA customers only paid approximately 65 percent of the costs associated with the energy resources procured on their behalf. This imbalance required PG&E customers who were not part of a CCA to pay approximately $180 million to subsidize CCA customers. Assuming this trend continues, in the early 2020s this amount is expected to grow to half a billion dollars, which is equal to the current PG&E low-income subsidy.**

TL;DR: The three major utility companies are stuck with old, expensive contracts, and are being undercut by cheaper competitors as a result.

That second article makes the proposal sound very similar to a referendum that Florida Power & Light tried to get passed a year ago, basically saying ""we can\'t force people who don\'t want solar power to subsidize anything for those who do.""

You can have it.\n\nI\'ll say that in the low teens and not far from where it was in 2008, it\'s probably not bad. It\'s not great and it\'s not going to turn overnight (and probably won\'t even ever truly ""turn""; I\'ve been saying for several months now on here that the solution is breaking GE up), but it\'s not going to 0. \n\nThat said, what irks me about these threads is that GE is where GE is for a very legit reason: this was a poorly managed company for a decade and a half. Rot set in while Immelt was there and their solution was to get a new CEO who ... was there during the entire Immelt period. An inspired, dramatic choice to change the company would probably be someone from the outside, not someone who had been at GE since the late 1980\'s. Flannery feels more like the person left to clean up the mess and when he was announced, the market then voted acccordingly for months after. I don\'t know that I\'ve ever seen such a horrible reaction to a new CEO at a large company and that was before people even really turned really negative on what Immelt left (the ""Immelt traveled with an extra plane"" stories, etc) I see 6/12/17 as when Flannery was announced. The stock is -51% since.\n\nGE was about $60ish when Immelt took over, $40 by 2007 and $20 last year. Maybe it\'s just me but that seems like a fairly lengthy trend lower.\n\nThis isn\'t a good company that suddenly became out of favor. They\'re likely to break it up... which Flannery should have done from day one rather than try to turn around the house that Immelt ruined.\n\nEdited: https://www.benzinga.com/news/18/04/11509755/ge-could-be-evaluating-hybrid-deals-ipo-spinoffs\n\n', ""I agree.\n\nLooking at GE in aggregate, it looks bad. But if you look at GE in business segments, the business segments that are expected to do well 10-20 years down the road are doing PHENOMENAL. \n\nI don't have a source (on mobile, sorry) but the industrial segments like power, renewables, have been doing spectacularly well. We're talking like 30% plus YOY growth in those segments. What is dragging them down is consumer segments like lighting which I am guessing they are either going to split up into industrial and consumer and sell off the consumer unit, or sell it altogether but keep the R&D unit and license patents and what not.\n\nThey are slowly transitioning from a conglomerate to an industrial-specific conglomerate. Instead of selling washing machines at $1,000 a pop and having to open up call centers (expenses) to service that business unit, they are building multi-billion power grids for entire countries that will rack up 10's of millions if not hundreds of millions or a few billion in consulting fees (revenue, profit).\n\nIn any transition to completely change the vision of a business, there's going to be collateral damage. Having that collateral damage be weak earnings but with $350 in backlog orders and otherwise decently strong financials... I'll take it.\n\nLong term, its a great investment.

I'm saying that there seems slim chance of it being a major multi-bagger, having already reduced their dividend (again), and with the potential of more accounting problems yet to be uncovered. What are you really hoping for here? For it to get back to 30 from where it is now at 13? In how many years? I see other beaten down cheap things which I think will get better gains than that in a similar time frame without GE's risks. Or are you just hoping for steady 10% every year?

RF04-20,8dvboz,5 great long ideas that you should know about,1524311984.0,4,2,"**Growth Stocks**

**Cognex Corp** 
Cognex Corp (CGNX) stock price has dropped 30% over the past six months largely due to a once off tax charge that meant earnings increased by “just” 19% in 2017. However analysts looking beyond that non-recurring charge would see Q4 revenue increased 39% and adjusted net income rose 46%. That follows years of strong 30% earnings growth.

The company, which makes machine vision systems to capture digital images that can be processed by computers, has a bright future. The business is driven by automation, production lines and robotics and there is huge potential. Management project sales from areas such as 3D products and logistics will grow 50% annually. After the recent drop the stock trades on a TTM PE of 35. Given the fantastic prospects that looks cheap.

**Spartan Motors**
Speciality Vehicle manufacturer Spartan Motors (SPAR - beware small cap stock) has had a good year in 2017 with revenues up 20% and earnings up c.86% (fourth quarter earnings more than doubled). The CEO said that the performance will ""provide a sound foundation for future long-term growth, increased shareholder value and an acceleration of earnings growth in 2018"".

The company has a rosy outlook with significant opportunities from entering the fragmented commercial and retail market, from an expanding e-commerce delivery business that supports the growing number of retailers entering the home delivery segment and from its optimal position to serve the growing alternative fuel market for the large fleet operators.

That's a lot of positives driving recent growth and enabling the company to guide for revenue growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 39% in 2018.

Given all the good news its no surprise the stock price has doubled over the past year. But with a price/sales of 0.83 and a 2019 forward PE of 15 the stock still looks good value.

Please be aware that with a market cap of $600 million Spartan Motors is a small cap stock with elevated risks and little liquidity.

**Value Stocks**
Rocky Mountain (RME) agricultural dealerships trades on a pretty cheap valuation (TTM PE 10.5) and pays a decent dividend (3.7%). For a cyclical dealership that would suggest that its nearing the end of the upcycle, but the outlook for Rocky Mountain looks positive for a number of reasons.

Steep manufacturer price increases in 2016 and 2017 have held back demand and a jump in sales is expected. Farmers incomes are faring reasonably well and farmers can only hold off upgrading tractors in the short term -- eventually pent up demand returns with force.

If that demand is coupled with multiple expansion to a reasonable PE of 12 or even 14 investors would see significant upside of 40% or more.

**Insider Buying**
At Ryman Hospitality Properties (RHP), the hotel REIT, CEO Colin V. Reed purchased $487,291 of stock on Tuesday. It was his second purchase year having purchased $450,000 in January. It comes after a very strong performance in 2017 with net income increasing 10.5 percent to $176.1 million for the year.

Mr Reed said at that time “With limited new supply coming online for the foreseeable future, and our own high-return capital projects scheduled to open throughout 2018, we believe we are in a prime position to benefit from this unique opportunity in both the near and long-term.” In guidance Mr Reed said he believed 2018 was shaping up to be a strong year and that the forward book of business was as strong as it has ever been and guided for adjusted EBITDA to increase 8.3%.

That positive outlook is supported by Citi analyst Michael Bilerman who upgraded RHP earlier this month due to its promising growth outlook. With a yield of 4.3% and decent growth prospects other investors may want to join Mr Reed.

**Microcap**
RF Industries Limited (RFIL) is a high risk microcap with a market capitalisation of just $50 million. That said it has seen a remarkable level of growth in recent quarters with revenues increasing 56% year on year in the first quarter and a loss of $339,000 became a profit of $454,000. The company provides products and systems for radio frequency (RF) communications and wireless with notable applications for mobile networks.

Growth was reported across all divisions and management said they were beginning to see very early preparations for the roll out of 5G for which RFIL produce the cable, the connectors, the jumpers, all the equipment to allow the radio systems to function. That’s going to provide huge growth over the next two years and RFIL is already seeing the benefits.

The company reported an increase in backlog to $20.2 million as of January 31, 2018 compared to $4 million at October 31, 2017. Thats huge growth for a company with annual sales of $30 million. It’s more notable given RFIL has historically not had a large backlog and indeed it’s rarely ever been disclosed.

The stock price has increased 266% over the past year but with revenue growth of 50%, the company’s return to profitability and a valuation of 1.25 times annualised sales -- that looks cheap.

**For the record, I don’t own any of these stock. I am not being paid to write this. I am not a bot. I just found the ideas interesting.**

AMP04-23,87j51j,My portfolio hit 500k!,1522163231.0,467,1477,"My goal is to retire early so it's nice to hit this milestone early on in my career.

I'm 33 and just about to celebrate my 10 year anniversary of being employed. Plan is to retire around 40-45 and then focus on my hobbies. 

I don't bring in a ridiculous salary but have had a high savings rate and good luck with returns. I'm frugal so I can maintain a decent savings rate despite living in a relatively expensive northeast suburb. My rent is $1850 as an example although I split that cost with my Fiancee. 

According to the ss.gov website, my gross income average since I started working has been $70254. I started at $45,000 when I graduated in 2008. It's doubled since then and now I can finally pump more money into individual accounts. It's pretty awesome to have a portfolio that's probably equal to my actual net income after taxes. The power of compounding!

I max out the 401k and Roth IRA each year with index funds. Index funds make up about 65% of my investment income and the rest is individual securities. I've had a great run with some individual picks that have driven results quite a bit(UNH, MKL are my two biggest holdings and I bought a bunch of UNH in the 20s all the way up to the 100s). I actually sold a bunch of UNH when it became too big a part of my portfolio in the 130s and now it soared all the way up to 220. Risk management can sometimes come at the expense of returns but I'd rather not how so much exposure to one stock. Still hold a good portion of their stock though and like the company. I've also played around with options a bit but in a very small way. Again most of my money is in index funds so my overall returns haven't been that far above the S&P 500 although I've eclipsed it a little bit. 

My strategy has been to follow a strict investment plan since I started although I only got serious about tracking my asset allocation closely in the past few years. My investment plan also allows me to hold up to 10% max in cash as part of my portfolio when I can't find any good deals out there. I always have money flowing into the market though via bi weekly 401k contributions. 

I'm pretty amped to get there so early due to the crazy bull market we've had and am not worried if there's a move in the other direction. I'm still likely 10+ years out and plan to keep pumping money in for a while so lower prices are better for me from a long term return perspective. 

Just wanted to say YAY and show everyone that it doesn't take a ton to make things work as long as you're consistent.

EPS: $3.27 per share vs $1.26 per share, as estimated, according to Thomson Reuters*

AWS revenue: $5.44 billion vs. $5.25 billion, as estimated, according to FactSet

Amazon's revenue, which includes sales from Whole Foods, increased 43 percent year-over-year. Its North America revenue jumped 46 percent to $30.7 billion, while international sales grew 34 percent to $14.8 billion.


Amazon's cloud unit, AWS, continued to be the growth driver of the company. For the quarter, AWS sales grew 49 percent year-over-year, to $5.44 billion, while generating $1.4 billion in operating income, a whopping 73 percent share of Amazon's total operating income.


In a prepared statement, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos highlighted the massive success of AWS.


""AWS had the unusual advantage of a seven-year head start before facing like-minded competition, and the team has never slowed down,"" said Bezos. ""As a result, the AWS services are by far the most evolved and most functionality-rich.""


During the earnings call, investors will look for clues around Amazon's plans for political damage control, further growth in its dominant cloud service, and investments in new segments, like Alexa and logistics.


Amazon continues to outperform the market with its stock up over 20 percent this year.


Amazon gave revenue guidance in the range of $51.0 billion to $54.0 billion, in-line with street estimate of $52.2 billion.

FE04-23,873zjz,"Wells Fargo thinks its time to buy into the sell-off, even with fears over trade wars and rate hikes",1522014226.0,1,7,"CNBC: Last week, tech stocks sold off, the Federal Reserve hiked rates, and President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) [inflamed tensions with the world's second largest economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/23/china-urges-us-to-pull-back-from-the-brink-as-trump-picks-trade-weapons.html).

To one market analyst, all of the above means it's not a time for investors to worry; it's time to buy.

""We're trying to get our clients to buy on these pullbacks,"" Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo, told CNBC's ""[Futures Now](https://www.cnbc.com/futures-now/)"" recently. ""We think this thing still has some upside the rest of the year.""

The market cycle is not over, says Wren. He sees the tax changes that were passed late last year by Congressional Republicans providing extra economic stimulus, and likely extending the growth cycle by at least another year. Tax stimulus should give a big boost to [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.SPX)corporate earnings this year.

On top of that, Wren expects the U.S. economy to reach 2.9 percent growth this year, up from 2.3 percent in 2017, without too much additional inflation pressure.

These factors make equity markets particularly attractive to Wren.

""Valuations are not stretched,"" he said. ""Are they at the average or the median? No they're not, they're a little bit higher than that, but they're not dramatically higher than that.""

The price\-to\-earnings ratio on S&P 500 stocks remain at elevated levels of recent years, though the metric has sharply declined since highs seen at the beginning of the year.

The benchmark index currently trades at 16.5 times forward earnings, down from an 18.6 times multiple at the end of January when it last hit record highs. That is still a far cry from the dotcom bubble era, when the S&P 500 traded as high as 25.8 times earnings at the tail\-end of the boom.

The [potential for a U.S. trade war with China](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/22/china-responds-to-trump-tariffs-with-proposed-list-of-us-products-to-target.html) sent markets tumbling last week, but Wren sees the likelihood of all\-out conflict at just 20 percent. Wren expects markets to react as they have in recent weeks – with an immediate sell\-off on new developments, but then a subsequent rebound.

""This is going to be on the front burner for the next couple of years,"" he said. ""I just really think this is not going to be an all\-out trade war, but obviously the market is worried about that and certainly if that would happen that wouldn't be a good thing.""

The next market worry is the Fed, says Wren. The central bank [raised borrowing costs last week for the sixth time since the financial crisis](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/23/4-things-to-do-with-your-money-when-the-fed-raises-rates.html), a move widely expected by markets. Higher economic projections did come as a mild surprise, pushing up the possibility of a fourth rate hike by year's end.

""Four is a mistake. I think that the Fed is not behind the curve. I do think finally the labor market is getting tight,"" said Wren. Unless ""you think inflation is going to jump higher, which we really don't, four seems extreme to me.""

The market is pricing in an above\-average chance of another rate hike in June and September, according to CME Group Fed Funds futures. A fourth rate hike in November or December is also seen as a possibility.

Even with changes to monetary and trade policy, Wren remains bullish on the stock market. He reiterates his midpoint price target on the S&P 500 at 2,850 for the end of the year. A finish at that level marks a 6.6 percent advance for the year.

> FirstEnergy Corp.’s competitive arm FirstEnergy Solutions (FES) and several key subsidiaries, including FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Co. (FENOC), on March 31 sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. FirstEnergy said the move would facilitate an “orderly financial restructuring” and accelerate its strategy to become a fully regulated utility.

> In a much-criticized move, FES on March 29 also filed an application for an emergency order with the DOE under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, urging Energy Secretary Rick Perry to “find an emergency condition exists” in PJM’s region, and to force PJM to compensate at-risk merchant nuclear and coal plants to maintain stability of the grid.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-of-firstenergys-power-generation-businesses-file-for-bankruptcy-1522621469

> The bankrupt FirstEnergy affiliates operate seven power facilities in Midwestern power markets where aggressive competition from cheaper gas-fired and renewable energy sources has undercut the economics of traditional nuclear and coal plants.

> The FirstEnergy Corp. parent company isn’t part of the chapter 11 case, nor are other company subsidiaries that operate in regulated electricity markets. But creditors are considering asserting claims that the parent failed to honor its financial obligations to the bankrupt units, a person familiar with the matter said.

> The company’s collection of coal and nuclear plants had been flirting with bankruptcy since last year when FirstEnergy announced it would exit competitive power markets and refocus on its regulated businesses.

> As part of the bankruptcy, FirstEnergy Solutions is seeking to scrap its unprofitable contracts to buy power from wind- and solar-power plants. The company is asking a bankruptcy judge to step in and rule that FERC can’t force FirstEnergy to continue to honor the deals. 

> FirstEnergy Solutions, which had 2017 revenue of $3.1 billion, plans to pursue a “dual-path exit from chapter 11”—either via a creditor-supported chapter 11 plan or the sale of some or all of the assets—according to court papers.

https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/coal-nuclear-plant-operator-files-for-bankruptcy-asks-trump-for-a-bailout/

> Although FERC denied Perry's proposed rule in January, FirstEnergy is banking that Perry, and by extension the Trump Administration, would be willing to issue an emergency order to keep its plants running under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act. According to the DOE, that rule is meant to ensure grid operations during emergencies.

> The rule was used six times between 2000 and 2008, in response to California's 2000 energy crisis and Hurricane Katrina, among other events. The rule wasn't used again until 2017, when the DOE permitted a coal generator to continue operation for four months at the Grand River Energy Center in Oklahoma while a new gas generator came online. It was also used in June 2017 to permit the limited run of two coal-fired generators in Virginia.

Based on my preliminary DD, FE is making a late/slow transition to natural gas plants. I'm still trying to determine how much revenue/profit FE's subsidiaries were contributing to FE.

FE severed their ties with FES the day before the bankruptcy filing (including denying FES from accessing FE's bank accounts), but it looks like some of the creditors are insisting that FE should be responsible for their bankrupt subsidiaries' debt.

I'm expecting the market to react as if FE itself is filing for bankruptcy in the short term.

In the long term, the question is how will those bankruptcies be handled (with creditors wanting to go after FE), if FE's subsidiaries can get government bailout using a rule that has been used before, and if FE can shift their business to avoid being crushed by cheap natural gas and stagnant electricity demand.

What am I going to do? Haven't decided yet.",1.0,"[""First time commenting on this thread but I happen to be keeping a close eye on this myself. FE has been cut-clear on its intentions to get out of the deregulated generation business in order to shore up its value on WS. \n\nFEU (aka FE) itself is independent of FES (generation) and is solely banking on revenue garnered from delivering and distributing energy across its footprint.  Why? Because operating and maintaining a nuke plant can't compete with natural gas in a deregulated market.  They tried and although it'd be easy to say they failed, it's also easy to say that maybe electricity generation - while historically a private industry - shouldn't be open to the free market.  \n\nBack to my point - FE is positioning itself into a predictive, conservative revenue pattern by getting out of the generation business.

Notably, MMM, CAT, AAPL, and DWDP were down 9.22%, 7.7%, 7.35% and 7.21% respectively as the market seemed to sell these Mega-Cap names as they may be more negatively impacted by a trade war. 

Was this sell-off warranted across the market in general, and more specifically did these Mega-Cap stocks deserve this type of reaction? It seems to be consensus that China benefits more in its trade relationships with the majority of its G7 trading partners. However, trade representatives from the US and China have issued statements reporting that trade negotiations are occurring and that both countries are not interested in a trade war.

KO04-24,87zqo0,Critique my “strategy”?,1522313418.0,3,7,"Good evening all,

I have been lurking this subreddit for awhile, and have been trading for 2 years now.  Over the past 2 years, I have lost money trying short term day trades/swing trades and options plays.  Had some very good days, and very bad days.

This whole greedy short term thing I was trying to do came to a head on Feb 5th with the implosion of SVXY/XIV.  I was long both UVXY and SVXY at the close of that day, but obviously the correlation between the 2 broke down completely and I lost a disproportionate amount of money in SVXY.  I didn’t lose my shirt but it was still extremely painful.

I have actually started taking everyone’s advice on here with just passive indexing, but with a bit of a difference.  I do own stocks that I never plan on selling, ever.  XOM KO PFE PG GIS (bought after the drop recently) and EIX.  Adding to these is not my priority at this time, just want to have some boring “safe” stocks in my portfolio that pays decent dividends.  However, the core position of my portfolio is VTI.  

A little over half of my account balance is invested in all of these, with VTI being 22% of my current holdings.  I will continue to passively invest in this monthly with money deposited into my account.  The other half of the cash is tied up in limit orders for VTI; buying more if it drops 5% (this order already got triggered) 10%, 15%, 20%.  I know I am essentially “timing the market” with this, but I guess the reason is I just don’t know wtf is going to happen, and don’t want to throw everything in all at once.

I’m not ashamed to admit that last month shook me out, big time.  The past 2 years I have been following the market and it just seemed to go up every day, especially last year.

CAT04-24,8c11wy,5 great long ideas that you should know about,1523641170.0,32,46,"All feedback and comments very welcome

**Value Stocks** Caterpillar (CAT) is poised to deliver earnings per share growth of more than 30 percent this year according to a analysts, while the firm projects peak earnings of $16 per share four to five years from now. Currently priced at $150 the stock trades on a forward PE of less than ten. With Caterpillar's mining and construction markets around the world showing signs of a turnaround, thats a multiple that may appeal to value investors. 

Cemex (CX) is technically a Mexican cement company but with 50% of assets in the US and the financials based in dollars its about as American as almost any stock on the NYSE. The Mexican connection has held back CX as other construction companies have benefited from a strong US economy and increased Federal spending plans. But Merrill Lynch has said that all that political risk is more than priced in and that a weak dollar and strong growth in the US, Europe and the Philippines will ""drive strong earnings"". With the stock down 30% over the past year and a TTM PE of 12.9 it looks pretty cheap 

**Insider Buying** With the stock down nearly 40% DDR Corp (DDR) and yielding 10% director Alexander Otto has been snapping up stock with 7 purchases this year totaling about $40mn. Mr Otto is from the Otto dynasty that owns c.80 million square feet of U.S. office space and European shopping malls. His father Werner started the business back in 1949, so Alexander is well connected and, more importantly, seems comfortable enough with DDRs strategy and valuation to make numerous purchases in quick succession.

He’s not the only one, SumZero have given DDR a target price of $12 (compared to current stock price of $7.30). They are not the only contrarian investors out there supporting retail assets. Hedge funds and analysts are increasing beginning to realise that the demise of some retailers does not mean the end of retail malls and assets. Mall owners have shown ability to repurpose malls to bring in new retailers and reposition the real estate for new experiences such as movie theaters, child zones, and restaurants. That means that there is value and insiders, hedge funds and others are snapping up assets on the cheap.

**Growth Stocks** Solaredge Technologies (SEDG) has reported earnings growth of 40% for years so it’s not surprising that it trades on a lofty TTM PE of 30. In 2017 earnings grew 65% and SEDG Chairman and CEO, Guy Sella, said he was sure the company could maintain the trajectory of growth in 2018. The level of solar power generation is rising rapidly and the company has issued guidance for 70% sales growth in Q1 2018. With consensus 2018 estimates of $2.96, if the stock achieves that (reasonable) PE multiple of 30, it would see the stock rise an impressive 60% to $88.

DLH Holdings (DLHC) provides professional healthcare and public services to Government agencies and has seen steady exponential growth over the past 5 years. EBITDA has been growing by 100% annually. Looking ahead, management remain optimistic about the pipeline. In particular DLH, which offers drug and alcohol counseling services, could see expanded funding to fight opioid abuse. Given rapid growth the TTM PE of 16.8 and forward 2018 PE 12.5 looks very cheap. (please be aware this is a high risk microcap stock)

I analyzed what categories are left for China to “retaliate” this round. It is not hard to guess since they only had $130B to begin with, and 1/3 were already selected during last round.

Just to clarify, for aircrafts they only included narrow bodies such as 737s. Wide-body aircrafts (787,747,777) could potentially be included this round. BA must be panicking right now.

Also these are US categories so they don’t 100% overlap with the ones announced by Chinese. For example Chinese only levied tariff on Beef but it is grouped with Meat and poultry. You get the point.

> NextEra Energy announced that it is the counterparty to a major supply agreement that was announced by JinkoSolar in January. The companies amended the agreement this month, and JinkoSolar will supply NextEra Energy with up to 2,750 megawatts of high-efficiency solar modules -- roughly 7 million solar panels -- over approximately four years.

I wouldn't be surprised if one of the reasons for JinkoSolar setting up the new plant is to get around the solar panel tariff while still being able to meet NEE's solar panel demands.

BA04-25,8cxgiy,"If you had to choose a few companies in a few sectors to invest in, what would you invest in? Why?",1523979409.0,11,0,"I, personally, as the amateur wannabe investor I am, would invest in the following:

Technology -

Microsoft (MSFT): Stable growth over the past thirty something years, constantly competes with Apple and Google for market share. 

Google (GOOGL): Similarly, Google has held a large portion of the tech market along with making insane profits annually. As an added benefit, it has steadily grown and the only thing I can think of that's negative is the YouTube bots fiasco. 

Tesla (TSLA): This just out of fanboyism, I love Elon Musk. He's awesome. And, anyway, Tesla does civilian and governmental contracting, e.g selling cars to the public and solar panels to the government, etc. 

Gaming and eSports:

Activision Blizzard (ATVI): The world's leading video game publisher, also owns Overwatch of which I, and others, love. 

Riot Games (HKG: 0700): League of Legends is consistently one of the most watched game on Twitch and the tournaments for the game net millions. The industry can only grow too, us kids aren't just going to stop playing. 

Transportation:

Boeing (BA): Boeing is an unstoppable juggernaut. Airlines love them, people love them, and countries love them. They sell airplanes, rockets, satellites, all the cool stuff, and they own a huge percent of the aeronautics industry. They're unstoppable!

Pharmaceuticals:

AbbVie Inc (ABBV): Will eclipse $35bn by 2025, and, like JNJ, pays out good dividends. Revenue is growing very fast, with Wall Street believing ABBV will have a 16% annualized profit growth each year for the next five. That's pretty fast. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): While it did lose profit by losing its patent protection, it recently launched two new megablockbuster drugs of which are offsetting these losses. Might be fun to see how this stock does. 

Johnson and Johnson (JNJ): One of the best healthcare stocks, JNJ is growing faster than any other pharma corp and it yields an awesome dividend. 

Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND): Is a fast growing pharma corp that has a $2.9bn mid cap. Will also be interesting to see where this one goes. 

Index Funds:

Fidelity MSCI information Tech (FTEC): 27.49% annual returns according to USA News, and has $1.88bn worth of assets. 

Vanguard Information Technology (VGT): 27.5% annual returns, also according to USA News, and has $20.05bn worth of assets. 

Wall Street Bets:

Micron Techonology (MU): The stock goes up and down, up and down, just like my portfolio!

Nvidia (NVDA): Same reason as Micron. 

AMD (AMD): I'm an autist, alright? Leave me alone. 

Outside of stocks, I'd probably invest in some real estate in Delhi, Shanghai and/or Tokyo. Also, obviously, I'm joking about the r/wsb stuff. Anyways, what companies would you invest in? Why?

BA04-25,8dwyc3,ETFs/Equities,1524329466.0,7,0,"Thank you for taking the time to read my post and answer my questions. So here is a quick breakdown of my current investment. 

   I currently have a few Investment which include my pension approximately 20k in that account, a deferred compensation plan (437b) through Work that has approximately 6k. My 437b deducts 100$ bi weekly from my check into this account which is diversified into EQ/Large cap value index, EQ 500 index, some small caps, Invesco global real estate fund etc. I plan on increasing it to another $100 every year I make more money. This is a supplemental retirement income separate from my pension that is ran by an advisor that works in my department. It has done really well as I started in 2016 with a small minimum investment. I do not control the allocations in this account.
      I also have 3500$ in which I used to open up a Roth IRA account. I opened it a few years back and was advised to purchase mutual funds via American Funds. It did okay on an original 300$ investment and adding 100$ every month to that account. I recently transferred that money out and put it into a TD Ameritrade Roth IRA. I sold the American funds and bought a couple equities that I use on a daily basis and other stocks I researched that had good cash flow/dividend yields/cash flow positive/ technology in the cloud/ and things I use everyday. Because that’s what I read online to buy stocks that you use everyday. Think I saw that on Mad Money with Jim Cramer one time haha. So the companies I purchased a few shares of $BA, 2 shares of $AAPL, a couple shares of $MSFT a couple shares of $FB, $JPM . Not knowing much, I got clobbered right as the market corrected in early February. Held a few of the stocks and right now I’m down about $300 from that initial $3500 investment. I also just purchased a share of $AMZN at $1374 just for the hell of it. I love amazon and have prime and want to hold this for as long as I’m alive lol. 

So here are my retirement goals. Currently 30 years old with the aspirations to retire in year 2060. I want to minimize my risk in individual equities but also want a decent return on my investment. I would consider myself a moderate to higher risk investor as I am looking for solid return anywhere from 8-16% return year over year. I understand markets fluctuate and that number will fluctuate. 

     So my advisor through work isn’t the most accessible person to get a hold of so my question is how can I minimize my risk during market downturns and also limit my exposure to just individual equities. I have looked into vanguard target retirement 2055 symbol $VFFVX. But they have too much exposure to bonds right now where I feel I could be maximizing my exposure in the equity market. I’ve been looking into ETF such as $VTI $VOO $VWO to give myself a broader exposure to domestic, international and emerging markets. I love tech and aerospace and am interested in ETFs such as &
$QQQ and $ITA $DFEN. I am not a day trader but am investing for a long term buy and hold strategy.

> The Trump White House, confident that its hard-line strategy is succeeding, is planning to ratchet up the pressure on China by focusing on new tariffs and threatening to block Chinese technology investment in the U.S., according to officials familiar with the strategy.

> The additional moves come as President Donald Trump has told his senior aides to investigate the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a move that would reverse a Trump campaign promise and would further challenge China.

> For its part, China is looking to line up other countries against the U.S., Chinese officials said—especially in Europe, whose firms could benefit should China react to the stepped up pressure by retaliating against the U.S. Beijing has already responded to early volleys from Washington in the trade conflict with retaliatory tariffs of its own.

> Administration officials familiar with the U.S. strategy say that the U.S. Trade Representative, as early as next week, will detail which products are on the list of $100 billion in Chinese goods subject to 25% import tariffs. The initial hit list of $50 billion in Chinese imports didn’t include some consumer staples such as clothing, mobile phones or shoes, to minimize consumer impact and limit domestic criticism. But trade experts say the sheer size of the expansion of the hit list makes the inclusion of consumer goods inevitable.

> At the same time, the Treasury Department is crafting sharp prohibitions on Chinese investment in advanced U.S. technology, whether by acquisition, joint ventures, licensing or any other arrangement. The Treasury is targeting China’s subsidization of domestic industries to turn them into so-called technology national champions, said a senior administration official.

> The administration is debating whether to make the investment restrictions permanent, even if China changes its industrial policies, the official said. The restrictions then could be used to make sure China carries out pledges and would warn other countries not to mimic Chinese behavior. Treasury is supposed to devise a plan by early June.

> The actions come as administration officials argue the Chinese are already bending the U.S.’s will. They point to a speech on Tuesday by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who promised to roll out measures this year to lower tariffs on imported cars and to ease foreign ownership restrictions on auto makers in China.

Out of the four of them, Microsoft looks like the most solid buy, and not just because they’re the only American company aside from J&J to have a AAA credit rating.

Apple is a victim of its own success. The iPhone X will reportedly be discontinued due to it’s unjustifiably large thousand dollar+ price tag and lagging sales. Which is why the gold iPhone X was never introduced and the Product Red iPhone 8 is being promoted instead. Apple has invented nothing impressive after Jobs’ passing. The Apple Watch is a flop with apps being removed including Instagram, Amazon, Google Maps, EBay, Slack, and more, most likely due to a lack of use. Now the flip side to the argument as to why you should invest in AAPL is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is invested in Apple, and as of this writing AAPL is actually their largest holding. Buffett’s reasoning because Apple has a large “moat” meaning that consumer loyalty to the brand is super impressive. But with HomePod completely missing the targets and being a thorough disappointment with an inept Siri and again super high price tag, Apple is pushing the limits on what it can get away with. Maybe the Oracle of Omaha sees something I don’t, but when I want to see the cutting edge in technology I go to the Microsoft Store to test out Hololens, not see another iteration of the iPad Pro which now supports Pencil.

Google is a mixed bag with awesome strengths as well as warning signs it may just be a follower in the industry, and not a good one at that. The strengths of Google are that it still has a monopoly on search, its maps apps (Maps, Waze, Earth) are unrivaled, and it is dominating the classroom with its free online productivity suite of Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Not to mention the fact that YouTube is unrivaled, Google Chrome is unrivaled, and Android is unrivaled when it comes to an iOS alternative. The weaknesses of Google is that they sometimes have no idea what they are doing and fail spectacularly. Google Glass was creepy. Google Plus was lame. Google Nexus went nowhere. And even though Android is breaking record numbers as the world’s most popular OS, Google still clings to their vision of a webpage-centric OS in their flailing ChromeOS. So flailing in fact that they had to suck some energy from Android and make Android apps compatible with ChromeOS.

Amazon is a company I hate with a passion. They abuse their warehouse workers, Jeff Bezos is the richest person on the planet yet he refuses to donate to charity nor conduct interviews except for maybe one by his brother, and this hunger games Amazon is having cities do to impress them for a second headquarters is just messed up and totally fake (Boston is still in the running and they explicitly said they’re offering jack shit with regard to tax breaks). Plus reports are coming in that Whole Foods is being ruined from within: upper management has left, suppliers have left after fees were increased, produce is lagging in quality for the first time, stores are forced to become more centralized and less locally involved, and shelves are deliberately being left empty because of a new system of stocking which may be more efficient but looks awful. Can’t wait for Amazon to fail on this one just like they did with their Fire Phone.

Microsoft is by far the most impressive tech company on this list. Their hardware is top notch, making them safe in an era where companies who make their money on data, like Facebook and Google, are caught in the crosshairs of public perception and backlash. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is a thoroughly impressive individual who has worked at Microsoft for decades, is humble as well as decisive, and seems to be ready to cut tech that isn’t working for the company while fostering growth and innovation for sectors of the company that have potential or are currently working well. Microsoft Stores are opening up and introducing people to innovative tech straight from the company itself.

In summary I’d say that Microsoft is going to continue to trend upwards, Google’s fate is in their own hands, Apple is not going anywhere better, and Amazon will continue to slide. And when it comes to long term success, I’m more likely to invest in tech companies that do hardware and have a physical presence like their own stores (Microsoft, Apple) than companies who rely totally on reputation (Amazon, Google save for Nest and Pixel).",0.54,"['MSFT was a buy 2 years ago.

So Amazon is up like 40,000% in 15-20 years. It is still growing very strong like it's a startup IPO, thanks to a smart, determined business man in Mr.Bezos.  

Can this company go all the way to $350,000 per share like $BRK.A? We know the P/E is ridiculous but it never ceases to stop this train. 

With a quick calculation, Amazon can go to **$300,000/share** with the following outcome.

- 15% a year over 38 years 
- 20% a year over 29 years

Technology -

Microsoft (MSFT): Stable growth over the past thirty something years, constantly competes with Apple and Google for market share. 

Google (GOOGL): Similarly, Google has held a large portion of the tech market along with making insane profits annually. As an added benefit, it has steadily grown and the only thing I can think of that's negative is the YouTube bots fiasco. 

Tesla (TSLA): This just out of fanboyism, I love Elon Musk. He's awesome. And, anyway, Tesla does civilian and governmental contracting, e.g selling cars to the public and solar panels to the government, etc. 

Gaming and eSports:

Activision Blizzard (ATVI): The world's leading video game publisher, also owns Overwatch of which I, and others, love. 

Riot Games (HKG: 0700): League of Legends is consistently one of the most watched game on Twitch and the tournaments for the game net millions. The industry can only grow too, us kids aren't just going to stop playing. 

Transportation:

Boeing (BA): Boeing is an unstoppable juggernaut. Airlines love them, people love them, and countries love them. They sell airplanes, rockets, satellites, all the cool stuff, and they own a huge percent of the aeronautics industry. They're unstoppable!

Pharmaceuticals:

AbbVie Inc (ABBV): Will eclipse $35bn by 2025, and, like JNJ, pays out good dividends. Revenue is growing very fast, with Wall Street believing ABBV will have a 16% annualized profit growth each year for the next five. That's pretty fast. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): While it did lose profit by losing its patent protection, it recently launched two new megablockbuster drugs of which are offsetting these losses. Might be fun to see how this stock does. 

Johnson and Johnson (JNJ): One of the best healthcare stocks, JNJ is growing faster than any other pharma corp and it yields an awesome dividend. 

Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND): Is a fast growing pharma corp that has a $2.9bn mid cap. Will also be interesting to see where this one goes. 

Index Funds:

Fidelity MSCI information Tech (FTEC): 27.49% annual returns according to USA News, and has $1.88bn worth of assets. 

Vanguard Information Technology (VGT): 27.5% annual returns, also according to USA News, and has $20.05bn worth of assets. 

Wall Street Bets:

Micron Techonology (MU): The stock goes up and down, up and down, just like my portfolio!

Nvidia (NVDA): Same reason as Micron. 

AMD (AMD): I'm an autist, alright? Leave me alone.

BMY04-26,8cxgiy,"If you had to choose a few companies in a few sectors to invest in, what would you invest in? Why?",1523979409.0,11,0,"I, personally, as the amateur wannabe investor I am, would invest in the following:

Technology -

Microsoft (MSFT): Stable growth over the past thirty something years, constantly competes with Apple and Google for market share. 

Google (GOOGL): Similarly, Google has held a large portion of the tech market along with making insane profits annually. As an added benefit, it has steadily grown and the only thing I can think of that's negative is the YouTube bots fiasco. 

Tesla (TSLA): This just out of fanboyism, I love Elon Musk. He's awesome. And, anyway, Tesla does civilian and governmental contracting, e.g selling cars to the public and solar panels to the government, etc. 

Gaming and eSports:

Activision Blizzard (ATVI): The world's leading video game publisher, also owns Overwatch of which I, and others, love. 

Riot Games (HKG: 0700): League of Legends is consistently one of the most watched game on Twitch and the tournaments for the game net millions. The industry can only grow too, us kids aren't just going to stop playing. 

Transportation:

Boeing (BA): Boeing is an unstoppable juggernaut. Airlines love them, people love them, and countries love them. They sell airplanes, rockets, satellites, all the cool stuff, and they own a huge percent of the aeronautics industry. They're unstoppable!

Pharmaceuticals:

AbbVie Inc (ABBV): Will eclipse $35bn by 2025, and, like JNJ, pays out good dividends. Revenue is growing very fast, with Wall Street believing ABBV will have a 16% annualized profit growth each year for the next five. That's pretty fast. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): While it did lose profit by losing its patent protection, it recently launched two new megablockbuster drugs of which are offsetting these losses. Might be fun to see how this stock does. 

Johnson and Johnson (JNJ): One of the best healthcare stocks, JNJ is growing faster than any other pharma corp and it yields an awesome dividend. 

Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND): Is a fast growing pharma corp that has a $2.9bn mid cap. Will also be interesting to see where this one goes. 

Index Funds:

Fidelity MSCI information Tech (FTEC): 27.49% annual returns according to USA News, and has $1.88bn worth of assets. 

Vanguard Information Technology (VGT): 27.5% annual returns, also according to USA News, and has $20.05bn worth of assets. 

Wall Street Bets:

Micron Techonology (MU): The stock goes up and down, up and down, just like my portfolio!

Nvidia (NVDA): Same reason as Micron. 

AMD (AMD): I'm an autist, alright? Leave me alone.

IP04-26,88be82,Uber turned off safety system and turned down the LIDAR sensor from 1 to 7,1522425499.0,32,60,"This explains how it hit a person at near full speeds. This will certainly make it much much harder for UBER to get a self-driving license in the future. It wouldn't surprise me if one of the reasons they were rushing this out was because they realized they were falling behind or already pretty far behind in the self driving car realm. 

Quite frankly at this point I don't see why this company is valued so highly at all. They have no IP with their ride-sharing and their IP for their autonomous driving is being challenged by Google with what many consider a strong case and Lyft and many other programs will start to syphon their customer base. The whole idea of UBER tryign to pull an amazon of acquiring customer base and then turn it into a huge customer base for autonomous cars is just so far-fetched at this point. Oh did I mention that ride-sharing laws will eventually make their expenses go sky high and even harder to maintian a majority of market shares.

They have a long time before they go can public at this rate because i bet that's an ugly income statement.

EDIT: as someone else [linked](https://www.wired.com/story/uber-waymo-lawsuit-settlement/), Uber promised to not use Waymo technologies in their autonomous driving cars. This does explain why Google has no issues with self-driving vehicles but Uber does... again another blow to uber's self driving monopoly everyone keeps dreaming of",0.81,"['Rather than the reduction in LIDAR sensors, it\'s actually far more interesting that Uber\'s car performance is so bad:\n\n> ""[Google] cars went an average of nearly 5,600 miles before the driver had to take control from the computer to steer out of trouble.

There's usually a single rotary encoder on the roof in many vehicle and it looks like they just replaced the other LIDAR sensors with a RADAR system.  You're going to get a reduction in resolution by doing that, but frankly a RADAR system should still detect a sizable solid object.  And the roof mounted LIDAR should have likewise detected something.  The sensors that are most  likely to have trouble detecting the woman who was hit would be the cameras because it's extremely dark outside, poorly lit and she's wearing a black top.  Honestly given the speed the vehicle was traveling at and the fact that she wasn't crossing at an intersection at a fairly highspeed road in the dark makes this accident a hell of a lot more likely for a human driver too.  However there's no real reason that either the RADAR or LIDAR shouldn't have picked her up better than a human would have in that situation.\n\nAs for disabling Volvo's internal safety system, it's possible they either repurposed the sensors to feed data to their own self driving program or simply couldn't interface with it well enough to allow the two systems to coordinate.  In general a full self driving system should function way better a minimal accident avoidance system.\n\nI'm not sure how severe their LIDAR blindspot is here though.  It would have to be terrible to the point of making the LIDAR system almost useless for anything other than detecting static terrain though if it couldn't pick up a slow moving pedestrian walking across a really wide road.  It's possible that's the case given how far the camera package juts out on the volvo model.  That said the RADAR system should have still detected something if it's any good at all.\n\n~~What wasn't going to work worth a damn in this setting is the cameras.  You can see in the video they had maybe 2-3 seconds to react to the lady and the car was traveling around 38 mph.  That puts braking distance somewhere around 80 feet and she's flat out closer than that by the time she's visible.  It's possible/likely even if the human driver was attentive they wouldn't have noticed her since she was literally walking across a highway in a black shirt at night in the dark.  There's a clip of the driver in there and he is messing with the console a bit before but you can see he only notices her like a second before the car strikes her too.~~\n\nThe police seem to suggest this is also the case: \n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17142672/uber-deadly-self-driving-car-crash-fault-police\n\n~~The lady also made no attempt to wait for the car to pass to avoid it too so I don't know what's going on there exactly.~~\n\n~~Ultimately it's very likely a person in the same situation would have hit this lady.  That said there's no reason a self driving car should have really with it's range of superior sensors capable of functioning fine at night time.  This might be the first case where the problem is actually the self driving system failing to react BETTER than a human would.~~\n\nEDIT:  Video released by the police department is highly misleading of actual light levels at the area where she was struck.  I'm hoping Uber's cameras weren't all as bad as the one showing the accident, they could still be impacted if they were but any decent camera shows the intersection as relatively well lit which explains why the victim was so casual about crossing there to begin.  Assuming the actual self driving sensors are up to par this has to be a pretty massive failure of basic object detection across the entire suite of sensors."", 'Every time Uber does something, it’s like they don’t even take the lazy way out.

Why not keep every safety component permanently on and functioning at full capacity?"", ""r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/5722ro/something_interesting_sure_is_happening/\n\nYes, Uber is a middleman and is trying to use platform capitalism as its moat.  Yes, it is trying to apply the same avoidance of owning any assets to IP. \n\nAt the same time, the concept that it is merely an app developer focusing on connecting people (for a fee) is a business model that will be profitable in the future.  If ride-sharing fees get too absurd, they can always fall back on the idea and adjust the business as needed such that they are treated no differently than a carpool pinboard at the grocery store, where Uber is the store owner.\n\nUber can always adapt its business model by relying on the contracted drivers to own and maintain the autonomous cars rather than own them directly.  Or contract out the autonomy to a larger company like google while still leaching some of the profits along the way. That way, the legal risks would be pushed onto others but they would still make money.\n\nI agree that it is currently priced too high, but I don't think they will stop making money in the short term simply because their attempts at applying autonomous driving to expand the business are hitting a few speedbumps."", 'Eh, is ""Dan\'s Deals"" really a reputable news source?

RCL04-26,8e2n9n,4 interesting long opportunities that you should know about,1524395841.0,2,0,"United Rentals (URI), Sabre Corporation (SABR), Criteo (CRTO) and Royal Caribbean (RCL)

**United Rentals** (URI) operates in a cyclical industry with a volatile stock price but with a CAGR of 23% for earnings over the the past 5 years investors have been well rewarded.  Looking ahead the outlook remains bright.  The Purchasing Managers Index at 59% remains very optimistic about future growth.  Thats up from 55% a year ago with any result above 50% being a bullish forward indicator.  Long term trends for the industry are positive as companies realize the significant benefits from renting over ownership.  Additionally, as market leader URI enjoys significant economies of scale but with a market share of just 11% it still has a long runway for growth.  Trading on a multiple of 11 times consensus 2018 earnings it looks cheap. 


**Sabre Corporation** (SABR) is a travel technology company, the biggest service provider for air bookings in North America and connects the worlds leading hotels, car rental brands, rail carriers, cruise lines and tour operator with travel buyers.  That's a fast growing business with significant barriers to entry in the airlines solutions while hospitality is competitive.  The stock has fallen 33% over the past 2 years and trades on a TTM PE of 12.  However, Imperial Capital initiated coverage this week with a target price of $30 representing a 50% increase over Fridays close. With consensus 2020 earnings of $1.91 that looks quite reasonable.


With the stock down 50% and a forward 2018 PE of 12 **Criteo** (CRTO) looks cheap again. The company is a leading advertising company in the digital market space that hit problems last year when Apple blocked it from Safari browser users.  However the company has got over it with Q4 number report sales up 23% and earnings up 30%. With the stock down 50% and a forward 2018 PE of 12 it looks cheap again.

Finally Cruise Lines such as **Royal Caribbean** have had a great run with the stock rising more than threefold and EPS growing by 55% CAGR over the past 5 years.  Numerous tailwinds continue to boost the outlook with an aging population, strong growth in China and tax benefits in the US likely to provide a boost.  Earnings growth is likely to moderate going forward with consensus forecasts suggesting 15% annual growth.  With a 2018 forward PE of 13.6 the stock looks cheap at $119.00.  Stifel Nicolaus recently issued at $152.00 target price citing an expected positive revision to summer and full year guidance.  With reporting expected in the next couple of weeks investors may want to take a look.

I don\'t think I would do that.  \n  \nBut average down and keep at if the stock continues to fall.  That is the way I invest.  My most traded stock over many years is WDC and I expect that one has my longest strings of just buying more if it keeps falling.  \n  \nThe big plunge in WDC was start of 2016.  That was one of several times I bought it seven times at successively lower prices:  55.80, 54.96, 51.90, 47.71, 43.12, 40.20, 37.84 \n  \nThere was one stretch after that when I bought WDC 7 times in a row on declining prices and two stretches before that in which I also bought it 7 times (I didn\'t notice before now that each of those were 7 purchases).  The 2016 one was far more total shares in 7 purchases than the other times.  \n  \nMy last three WDC transactions were purchases at 97.46, 92.33 and 90.98  The pre-market bid is 92.81 at the moment.

GM04-26,89do1d,GM Throws Wrench in U.S. Auto Sales by Deserting Monthly Reports,1522761635.0,32,96,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-03/gm-ends-monthly-sales-reports-goes-quarterly-for-data-quality

> General Motors Co. will end a 25-year-long practice of disclosing monthly vehicle-sales results and shift to quarterly reporting, complicating investors’ efforts to gauge the health of the U.S. auto market.

> “Thirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market,” Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president of sales operations, said in a statement Tuesday. GM stopped holding a monthly conference call with analysts and media in January 2014 and discontinued releases of monthly production figures months earlier.

> GM’s break from tradition will impede investors’ ability to gauge the annualized sales pace of the world’s second-largest auto market on a monthly basis, as data from the top-selling car company in the country will go missing. The switch comes as analysts widely expect industrywide deliveries to slump for the second year in a row after an unprecedented seven-year growth spurt.

> On Tuesday, analysts had been expecting GM to post a 5.1 percent sales increase for March, the average of seven estimates. The automaker plans to release second-quarter sales on July 3, third-quarter sales on Oct. 2 and fourth-quarter sales on Jan. 3.

Out of the four of them, Microsoft looks like the most solid buy, and not just because they’re the only American company aside from J&J to have a AAA credit rating.

Apple is a victim of its own success. The iPhone X will reportedly be discontinued due to it’s unjustifiably large thousand dollar+ price tag and lagging sales. Which is why the gold iPhone X was never introduced and the Product Red iPhone 8 is being promoted instead. Apple has invented nothing impressive after Jobs’ passing. The Apple Watch is a flop with apps being removed including Instagram, Amazon, Google Maps, EBay, Slack, and more, most likely due to a lack of use. Now the flip side to the argument as to why you should invest in AAPL is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is invested in Apple, and as of this writing AAPL is actually their largest holding. Buffett’s reasoning because Apple has a large “moat” meaning that consumer loyalty to the brand is super impressive. But with HomePod completely missing the targets and being a thorough disappointment with an inept Siri and again super high price tag, Apple is pushing the limits on what it can get away with. Maybe the Oracle of Omaha sees something I don’t, but when I want to see the cutting edge in technology I go to the Microsoft Store to test out Hololens, not see another iteration of the iPad Pro which now supports Pencil.

Google is a mixed bag with awesome strengths as well as warning signs it may just be a follower in the industry, and not a good one at that. The strengths of Google are that it still has a monopoly on search, its maps apps (Maps, Waze, Earth) are unrivaled, and it is dominating the classroom with its free online productivity suite of Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Not to mention the fact that YouTube is unrivaled, Google Chrome is unrivaled, and Android is unrivaled when it comes to an iOS alternative. The weaknesses of Google is that they sometimes have no idea what they are doing and fail spectacularly. Google Glass was creepy. Google Plus was lame. Google Nexus went nowhere. And even though Android is breaking record numbers as the world’s most popular OS, Google still clings to their vision of a webpage-centric OS in their flailing ChromeOS. So flailing in fact that they had to suck some energy from Android and make Android apps compatible with ChromeOS.

Amazon is a company I hate with a passion. They abuse their warehouse workers, Jeff Bezos is the richest person on the planet yet he refuses to donate to charity nor conduct interviews except for maybe one by his brother, and this hunger games Amazon is having cities do to impress them for a second headquarters is just messed up and totally fake (Boston is still in the running and they explicitly said they’re offering jack shit with regard to tax breaks). Plus reports are coming in that Whole Foods is being ruined from within: upper management has left, suppliers have left after fees were increased, produce is lagging in quality for the first time, stores are forced to become more centralized and less locally involved, and shelves are deliberately being left empty because of a new system of stocking which may be more efficient but looks awful. Can’t wait for Amazon to fail on this one just like they did with their Fire Phone.

Microsoft is by far the most impressive tech company on this list. Their hardware is top notch, making them safe in an era where companies who make their money on data, like Facebook and Google, are caught in the crosshairs of public perception and backlash. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is a thoroughly impressive individual who has worked at Microsoft for decades, is humble as well as decisive, and seems to be ready to cut tech that isn’t working for the company while fostering growth and innovation for sectors of the company that have potential or are currently working well. Microsoft Stores are opening up and introducing people to innovative tech straight from the company itself.

In summary I’d say that Microsoft is going to continue to trend upwards, Google’s fate is in their own hands, Apple is not going anywhere better, and Amazon will continue to slide. And when it comes to long term success, I’m more likely to invest in tech companies that do hardware and have a physical presence like their own stores (Microsoft, Apple) than companies who rely totally on reputation (Amazon, Google save for Nest and Pixel).",0.54,"['MSFT was a buy 2 years ago.

> Global stocks rebounded Thursday but remained on track for quarterly losses after investor worries about rising rates, trade tensions and the health of the technology sector ended an extended period of calm.

> Ahead of the long holiday weekend, the Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.5% led by the auto sector, following small gains in Japan, Hong Kong and Shanghai. U.S. futures pointed to a 0.4% rise for the S&P 500 and a 0.8% boost for the Nasdaq .

> For the first three months of 2018, however, the S&P 500 was poised to lose roughly 2.6%, ending a nine-quarter winning streak, while the Stoxx Europe 600 was on track to end 4.6% lower, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 8% lower, and Japan’s Nikkei 7.1% lower, also hit by the dollar’s weak trajectory.

> While little was able to stir stocks for the past two years, markets have become more sensitive to any hints of bad news in the last two months, returning to a more elevated level of volatility and lower returns.

> With central banks moving gradually away from stimulus, tax cuts already passed and the early signs of acceleration in the global economy in the rearview, “the question now is how much newsflow can there be about things getting incrementally better versus getting incrementally worse,” said Chris Dyer, director of global equity at Eaton Vance.

> While he still is optimistic about global equities in light a healthy and upbeat corporate sector, “when you think about trade wars, North Korea, privacy and internet companies, there’s a lot that could scare investors,” he said.

> The S&P 500 has fallen 4% so far in March, on pace for its worst month since 2016, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 4.7%. Yields on 10-year Treasurys have risen to 2.77% from around 2.41% at the end of 2017.

> “You’re losing money in fixed income, losing money in equities: The average balanced account at the end of the first quarter is going to be down,” said Philip Blancato, chief executive at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.

> Just a handful of equity markets have clung to small gains for the year, including Italy’s FTSE MIB index, the Nasdaq Composite, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng.

> Still, Mr. Blancato and many investors remain encouraged about the outlook for the second quarter, pointing to continued momentum in the economy and corporate earnings.

KIM04-26,8dhw3w,Mattel CEO to leave the company,1524169919.0,3,8,"[WSJ link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mattel-ceo-margo-georgiadis-in-talks-to-leave-the-company-1524166521)


>Mattel Inc. MAT Chief Executive Margaret “Margo” Georgiadis is in discussions to leave the toy maker, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be an abrupt exit at a company struggling with slumping sales and in the midst of a restructuring.

>The former Google executive, who joined Mattel in February 2017, has been unable to reverse the Barbie doll and Hot Wheels maker’s fortunes. She has overhauled Mattel’s management team, suspended its dividend and unveiled plans to slash $650 million in costs.

>Details of her potential departure, such as who might replace her, couldn’t be learned. Last month, the company said it would elevate director Ynon Kreiz, a former studio executive who joined the board last year, to the role of executive chairman.

>Mattel shares have fallen nearly 50% since Ms. Georgiadis took over, chopping its market value to just under $5 billion. The company’s annual sales have slipped below those of rival Hasbro Inc., which The Wall Street Journal reported last fall was exploring a potential takeover. It is unclear where those discussions currently stand.

>Mattel, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., and has 28,000 employees, has cycled through several leaders in recent years. A new CEO would be the fourth in four years. Like her predecessor, Ms. Georgiadis didn’t have experience in the toy business before taking the job.

>Ms. Georgiadis was recruited to join the toy maker in late 2016, as Mattel was signaling confidence in the looming holiday season. But Mattel’s inventories piled up at retailers and didn’t sell as expected, and the company had to cut prices to try to salvage the most critical period in the year. Sales and profits plunged as a result.

>Instead of inheriting a company on the upswing, by the time she joined after the holidays, Ms. Georgiadis found herself trying to stabilize what was then the world’s largest toy company.

>She continued to uncover more problems at Mattel. Before she arrived, Mattel leadership was trying to recoup more than $400 million in sales it lost when Hasbro took over a major Walt Disney Co. license tied to the “Frozen” movie and other princess dolls. But the slew of smaller products it turned to in an effort to close the gap added complexity and costs, and didn’t have lasting power. Some of Mattel’s other brands, like Monster High and American Girl, also slumped.

>Mattel continued to struggle last year as it tried to reduce excess inventory at retail and had to cope with the bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys “R” Us Inc., one of its biggest sales channels. Mattel’s sales fell 11% last year, its fourth-straight year of declines. The company reports its latest quarterly results next week.

Ok, bear with me.
I closed out my Tesla short a little early and did not make as much as I could have.  The markets have been extremely skittish, up, down, up, down, like a porn star, lately, so I have had a tendency to grab profits when I have them.
Furthermore I have been saying for weeks that there would be a bounce in the stock when they came out with their March production numbers, because everyone knew they would be bad so everybody bet against them and could be counted on to close out after the report came out.

But the market as a whole looked bearish.
So I shorted GM.  There is a subprime crisis in cars happening and the interest rate hikes are hurting sales.

Tuesday, GM comes out with this bullish-sounding report and climbs 3%, so my short gets buried underwater.  I am pissed.
But first of all, I decided not to close out (buy back my shares) because the market has been up down up down up down.
And second, just because I am pissed off, I buy a put on SPY.  exp on Friday (April 4)  strike price 260.

You can have it.\n\nI\'ll say that in the low teens and not far from where it was in 2008, it\'s probably not bad. It\'s not great and it\'s not going to turn overnight (and probably won\'t even ever truly ""turn""; I\'ve been saying for several months now on here that the solution is breaking GE up), but it\'s not going to 0. \n\nThat said, what irks me about these threads is that GE is where GE is for a very legit reason: this was a poorly managed company for a decade and a half. Rot set in while Immelt was there and their solution was to get a new CEO who ... was there during the entire Immelt period. An inspired, dramatic choice to change the company would probably be someone from the outside, not someone who had been at GE since the late 1980\'s. Flannery feels more like the person left to clean up the mess and when he was announced, the market then voted acccordingly for months after. I don\'t know that I\'ve ever seen such a horrible reaction to a new CEO at a large company and that was before people even really turned really negative on what Immelt left (the ""Immelt traveled with an extra plane"" stories, etc) I see 6/12/17 as when Flannery was announced. The stock is -51% since.\n\nGE was about $60ish when Immelt took over, $40 by 2007 and $20 last year. Maybe it\'s just me but that seems like a fairly lengthy trend lower.\n\nThis isn\'t a good company that suddenly became out of favor. They\'re likely to break it up... which Flannery should have done from day one rather than try to turn around the house that Immelt ruined.\n\nEdited: https://www.benzinga.com/news/18/04/11509755/ge-could-be-evaluating-hybrid-deals-ipo-spinoffs\n\n', ""I agree.\n\nLooking at GE in aggregate, it looks bad.

We're talking like 30% plus YOY growth in those segments. What is dragging them down is consumer segments like lighting which I am guessing they are either going to split up into industrial and consumer and sell off the consumer unit, or sell it altogether but keep the R&D unit and license patents and what not.\n\nThey are slowly transitioning from a conglomerate to an industrial-specific conglomerate. Instead of selling washing machines at $1,000 a pop and having to open up call centers (expenses) to service that business unit, they are building multi-billion power grids for entire countries that will rack up 10's of millions if not hundreds of millions or a few billion in consulting fees (revenue, profit).\n\nIn any transition to completely change the vision of a business, there's going to be collateral damage. Having that collateral damage be weak earnings but with $350 in backlog orders and otherwise decently strong financials... I'll take it.\n\nLong term, its a great investment.

What are you really hoping for here? For it to get back to 30 from where it is now at 13? In how many years?

What happened the last time before that when they cut the dividend? The price dived as well. So currently, GE has only a few options:\n\n1. Up the dividend. Which it can do, but will probably screw up their restructuring because they kind of need less of a weight around their necks.\n\n2. Keep shedding their businesses. That makes them no longer much of a conglomerate, and more like a tech engineering stock. This is what they're trying to do now. The problem is that they need to reinvest profits possibly even more than they do now, that will continue to tank the stock until all the dividend income people have left the building.\n\n3. What I think they should do: buy back stock. It sort of solves both problems. The cash, when they feel like it instead of being forced to, lowers the available shares, which raises the market price.

BEN04-26,88z1dk,My Thoughts on Spotify's IPO,1522673241.0,117,226,"**THE SPOTIFY IPO & AGGREGATION THEORY**

I'm a huge Ben Thompson fan and his Aggregation Theory framework that describes how value has shifted away from companies that control the distribution of scarce resources to those that control demand for abundant ones.


[From Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/): ""Aggregation Theory describes how platforms (i.e. aggregators) come to dominate the industries in which they compete in a systematic and predictable way.""

What makes companies Aggregators? They have three key characteristics:

* Aggregators have a direct relationship with the user. This means customers pay the company directly.
* Thanks to the Internet, aggregators have zero marginal costs for serving an incremental user.
* Customer acquisition costs decrease over time because aggregators play in the digital world. The Internet means there is an abundance of supply and users value discovery and curation. Aggregators leverage discovery to deliver a superior service.

Unfortunately for Spotify, there is one major roadblock standing between the company and Aggregation. Record Labels.

Record labels present a unique challenge since the music industry has historically operated as an Oligopoly. Spotify gives the majority of every dollar in revenue that it generates to the record labels thanks to this pesky concept called wholesale transfer pricing.

[From 25iq](https://25iq.com/2013/06/12/wholesale-transfer-pricing-and-the-free-parking-business-model/): ""Wholesale transfer pricing = the bargaining power of company A that supplies a unique product XYZ to Company B which may enable company A to take the profits of company B by increasing the wholesale price of XYZ.""

For this reason, Spotify’s margins (currently 21%) are completely at the mercy of the record labels.

The good news for Spotify is that, thanks to its superior service (i.e. discovery), music streaming represents a growing slice of record label profits. Redburn, an equities research firm, estimates that in the first quarter of 2017 Spotify accounted for 17% of the $5 billon in revenues taken by record labels and last year total music revenues in the US grew to $8.7 billion, their highest level in a decade. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, streaming accounted for 65% of annual music revenue!

Spotify's F-1 reveals that 31% of listening now happens through playlists. This influence over user listening habits gives Spotify leverage and could allow it to sign new artists itself, effectively replacing the role of major record labels and solving its wholesale transfer pricing problem. If the company executes and becomes a (the?) dominant player in the music industry it would be a textbook example of Aggregation Theory.

My back of the napkin valuation for Spotify is the $16-25 billion range but the upside is significant. While success is far from certain, Spotify's ultimate appeal rest on its ability to achieve Aggregator status. I'll be watching closely.",0.9,"['They have stated multiple times they do not want to replace record labels, do you think its all talk for now? \n\n', '>Spotify\'s F-1 reveals that 31% of listening now happens through playlists. This influence over user listening habits gives Spotify leverage and could allow it to sign new artists itself, effectively replacing the role of major record labels and solving its wholesale transfer pricing problem.\n\nBeing a music label doesn\'t just mean you take an artist and put them on Spotify. It\'s about finding artists, backing them with advances (where most fail but hopefully the ones that succeed pay off the failed ones), then supporting them as you help to grow their careers. Yes Spotify could do that, but it\'s a completely different business.\n\nWould they have an edge due to the ability to steer their playlists towards their own artists? Perhaps, but first off they\'d need to be massive for it to make a difference, and secondly would they risk compromising the independence of their playlists to do that?\n\nNetflix can do it because most video content you consume is new content, and no video streaming service has ""all content"". So you\'re happy to go to Netflix for House of Cards or Altered Carbon, knowing that you can\'t see Billions.\n\nMusic streaming is different because while new music is important, many people still listen to older songs in their listening, so you\'ll never be able to cut out the major labels unless consumers accept Spotify with a missing chunk of music over competitors that have the full breadth. They can go the ""Spotify label"" route, but that\'s a long road given you\'re not just competing with other new music but all music past and present.', ""Look at netflix ten years ago and you see a similar picture.\n\nOld guard that doesn't want to change but then realizes their way is dying and they start to shut out netflix."", '+1 for wholesale transfer pricing reference. 25iq is easily one of the best blogs out there on business strategy.', '[deleted]', ""They seem to be in a very good position long term, but their IPO is so hyped that I wouldn't touch it for a couple of months. \n\nIt will sky rocket on the first day, then probably pull back over the next few months as the market as a whole stays sideways or is bearish. \n\nThat's when I would look to get in, when the market seems really low.

Spotify’s current model is variable costs. When Netflix scales their cost to produce the content stays the same but more users are watching it. When Spotify scales and more people are listening then the costs increase as well as they pay per listen.

And ""playlists"" is too broad of a descriptor to pull your exact analysis from; playlists could refer to curated lists such that you refer to, but it could also refer to playlists that people made for themselves. If that 31% of listening is all their curated lists that is pretty impressive actually, but if it is is more like 5% of all listening is their curated lists that is less impactful until they have a much, much larger user base. (And, as someone who does listen to their curated playlists, they really need to work on lowering the repetition factor, as the same 15 or so songs will show up in different playlists that are the same general genre every day. That kind of playlist is what has driven listeners away from radio for years.)\n\n\nJust a couple things to consider.

MAT04-26,8dhw3w,Mattel CEO to leave the company,1524169919.0,3,8,"[WSJ link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mattel-ceo-margo-georgiadis-in-talks-to-leave-the-company-1524166521)


>Mattel Inc. MAT Chief Executive Margaret “Margo” Georgiadis is in discussions to leave the toy maker, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be an abrupt exit at a company struggling with slumping sales and in the midst of a restructuring.

>The former Google executive, who joined Mattel in February 2017, has been unable to reverse the Barbie doll and Hot Wheels maker’s fortunes. She has overhauled Mattel’s management team, suspended its dividend and unveiled plans to slash $650 million in costs.

>Details of her potential departure, such as who might replace her, couldn’t be learned. Last month, the company said it would elevate director Ynon Kreiz, a former studio executive who joined the board last year, to the role of executive chairman.

>Mattel shares have fallen nearly 50% since Ms. Georgiadis took over, chopping its market value to just under $5 billion. The company’s annual sales have slipped below those of rival Hasbro Inc., which The Wall Street Journal reported last fall was exploring a potential takeover. It is unclear where those discussions currently stand.

>Mattel, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., and has 28,000 employees, has cycled through several leaders in recent years. A new CEO would be the fourth in four years. Like her predecessor, Ms. Georgiadis didn’t have experience in the toy business before taking the job.

>Ms. Georgiadis was recruited to join the toy maker in late 2016, as Mattel was signaling confidence in the looming holiday season. But Mattel’s inventories piled up at retailers and didn’t sell as expected, and the company had to cut prices to try to salvage the most critical period in the year. Sales and profits plunged as a result.

>Instead of inheriting a company on the upswing, by the time she joined after the holidays, Ms. Georgiadis found herself trying to stabilize what was then the world’s largest toy company.

>She continued to uncover more problems at Mattel. Before she arrived, Mattel leadership was trying to recoup more than $400 million in sales it lost when Hasbro took over a major Walt Disney Co. license tied to the “Frozen” movie and other princess dolls. But the slew of smaller products it turned to in an effort to close the gap added complexity and costs, and didn’t have lasting power. Some of Mattel’s other brands, like Monster High and American Girl, also slumped.

>Mattel continued to struggle last year as it tried to reduce excess inventory at retail and had to cope with the bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys “R” Us Inc., one of its biggest sales channels. Mattel’s sales fell 11% last year, its fourth-straight year of declines. The company reports its latest quarterly results next week.

Here are the options in no particular order:\n\n1 - a decade of 0% returns (negative returns after inflation)\n\n2 - five or six years of significantly negative returns (less than -10%, more than -5%)\n\n3 - fifteen years of returns greater than 0% but less than 7% (basically just slightly above inflation)\n\nThose, Dear Millennials (and boomers and Gex-Xers, etc.), are your choices.  You can try to ""Buy the Dip"", low cost index fund or DCA your way through this fast approaching market reality, but on the other end of it, there will be no Fed bailout and you will have to muddle your way through equities investment while being sporadically employed.

PEP04-26,8asak0,Dividend growth stocks with international exposure: PEP and KMB,1523215470.0,10,2,"So I am looking for dividend stocks with international exposure, meaning that a significant percentage of the income comes from outside the US.

The current panic on the markets has maybe created some opportunities. One of them would be Kimberly Clark (KMB), the other is PepsiCo(PEP). 

Both companies have a payout ratio of about 56% but KMB has a higher yield (3.6%) than PEP (2.9%). PEP has been growing dividends by an average of 8.7% whereas KMB could only grow its dividend by 5.2% per year on average in the last 5 years. 

What do you think which of the above companies would be a better idea to buy and hold for the next 10-20 years? Also do you think there are currently any other bargains on the market with a reasonable yield (2.5%+ ) and growth possibilities?

XOM04-27,87zqo0,Critique my “strategy”?,1522313418.0,3,8,"Good evening all,

I have been lurking this subreddit for awhile, and have been trading for 2 years now.  Over the past 2 years, I have lost money trying short term day trades/swing trades and options plays.  Had some very good days, and very bad days.

This whole greedy short term thing I was trying to do came to a head on Feb 5th with the implosion of SVXY/XIV.  I was long both UVXY and SVXY at the close of that day, but obviously the correlation between the 2 broke down completely and I lost a disproportionate amount of money in SVXY.  I didn’t lose my shirt but it was still extremely painful.

I have actually started taking everyone’s advice on here with just passive indexing, but with a bit of a difference.  I do own stocks that I never plan on selling, ever.  XOM KO PFE PG GIS (bought after the drop recently) and EIX.  Adding to these is not my priority at this time, just want to have some boring “safe” stocks in my portfolio that pays decent dividends.  However, the core position of my portfolio is VTI.  

A little over half of my account balance is invested in all of these, with VTI being 22% of my current holdings.  I will continue to passively invest in this monthly with money deposited into my account.  The other half of the cash is tied up in limit orders for VTI; buying more if it drops 5% (this order already got triggered) 10%, 15%, 20%.  I know I am essentially “timing the market” with this, but I guess the reason is I just don’t know wtf is going to happen, and don’t want to throw everything in all at once.

I’m not ashamed to admit that last month shook me out, big time.  The past 2 years I have been following the market and it just seemed to go up every day, especially last year.

AIG05-02,8baldv,AIG warrants,1523388767.0,1,7,"I was looking into investing into the AIG warrants for 2021 and there is one thing I do not understand. 

According to the FAQ in Investor Relations the warrants pay dividends, however, they are very irregular. How do they exactly decide the amount? 

I have read the 8-K and I know how the adjustments work but I have not found anything about the dividends.",1.0,"['While I am not familiar with these specific warrants I might be able to offer some information related to this issue.\n\nThe first point is that warrants are a derivative which means their value is derived from an underlying instrument. In the case of warrants, the underlying security is the common stock. Another derivative in which the underlying security is a common stock is an option. The distinction between the two is that warrants are derivative securities in which the investor transacts directly with the corporation who has issued the common stock. So in this case, investors gave AIG cash and received warrants in return. Options are derivatives traded on the secondary market between two investors. This difference causes issues with how future dividend payments are applied to the price of the derivative.\n\nSince options are traded between two investors, each party likely has a view on the expected future dividend payouts and incorporates this information when determining at which price they\'d be willing to buy or sell a given option. Warrant agreements are determined at the time of their issuance, with investors assessing the future value of the firm and comparing that to the strike price of the warrants. However, just like options, the future value of the stock relative to the strike of the warrant is determined by what percentage of the firm\'s future earnings is paid out as dividends. Consider the following example:\n\nStock is worth $100 and earns $5 per year for 3 years and pays no dividends. Excluding taxes and any change in the multiple relative to earnings, at the end of year 3 the stock will be worth $115, the current price plus three years of earnings.\n\nNow consider the same exact scenario but now the firm pays out 100% of its earnings as dividends. At the end of year three, the investor will have a $100 stock plus 3 years of $5 dividends now as cash. Total value is still $115 to the investor but the stock is priced at $100.\n\nIf there were warrants on this stock for $105, in the first scenario, the warrant would be worth $10 ($115-$105) and in the second it would be worthless. However, this doesn\'t square with the fact that both scenarios saw the same amount of ""value"" creation over those 3 years i.e. $15 in earnings. To rectify this problem, the issuing firm will adjust the strike price of the warrant downward every time the Company pays a dividend on the underlying security. This adjustment downward ensures that the value of earnings created by the firm is counted when considering the value of the warrants, regardless of whether or not the company pays out their future earnings as dividends.\n\nHope this helps!']"

TAP05-02,8c1var,Sharing an Interesting Market Indicator I Created using Fed Data - Consumer Credit to Savings Rate,1523647554.0,10,9,"**[See Google spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ysnMx5UelwkHBsJCCyNfyCXzI_E5UIx-Pld3tB5WwI/edit#gid=0)**

**Looking at Consumer Credit to Savings Rate Historically**

Hey everyone, so an interesting trend I noticed around Christmas time was the rapid expansion in consumer credit at the same time that consumer savings rates were drawing down. One can easily see how this may be bearish, although some people mentioned to me it could be bullish in that it indicates strong consumer sentiment about the forward economy.

So I decided to look at this from a more analytical and historical perspective. It turns out that there was a big spike in this ratio that times almost perfectly with the past two market tops. Data further back than that is a little murkier since consumer credit was far less than what we have now and the interest rates were much higher, leading to increased savings rates. 

I did account for interest rates in the calculations so that the savings rate is more ""normalized"" based off the risk free rate (I used 2 year bond yields as a proxy for this). 

**My two cents**

Consumer credit is inflationary int he short term, but deflationary in the long term. Much of 2017's growth was spurred by consumers taking on credit risk once again. That is good in the short term since the economy grows based on consumer spending. But once consumer savings run out, that forces consumers to either tap additional credit to keep up their spending habits, or to decrease their spending, which results in economic slowdowns. This results in either a economic slowdown, or a bigger growth in credit bubbles, only to result in bigger drawdowns down the line.

Based on this chart, we can see that the major indicator is when the slowdown (or drop after the peak) occurs after a big spike in the consumer credit to savings rate ratio. Fundamentally, this indicates that consumers are having a tough time paying their bills and that companies will see tougher time growing revenue in the face of increased consumer spending. It is a natural fit for a timer of market tops.

Everyone can draw their own conclusions. All data is taken from FRED.",0.72,"[""Consumer credit and savings rates are reported how often?  ...and the data looks back how far at each reporting juncture?  S&P500 is daily.  Shift the credit/savings ratio forward or backwards accordingly,\n\nIf there's one single thing economists (Fed data) are guilty of, it's driving using the rear view mirror."", 'Nice one!\n', 'Interesting finding\n\nOne suggestion: can you make the charts log scaled?', 'if you manage to make it as a graph that would be fantastic.', ""Thesis makes intuitive sense, but knowing where the next 'top' is on most indicators is a guessing game.

TAP05-02,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,6,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

EL05-02,8dhw3w,Mattel CEO to leave the company,1524169919.0,3,8,"[WSJ link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mattel-ceo-margo-georgiadis-in-talks-to-leave-the-company-1524166521)


>Mattel Inc. MAT Chief Executive Margaret “Margo” Georgiadis is in discussions to leave the toy maker, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be an abrupt exit at a company struggling with slumping sales and in the midst of a restructuring.

>The former Google executive, who joined Mattel in February 2017, has been unable to reverse the Barbie doll and Hot Wheels maker’s fortunes. She has overhauled Mattel’s management team, suspended its dividend and unveiled plans to slash $650 million in costs.

>Details of her potential departure, such as who might replace her, couldn’t be learned. Last month, the company said it would elevate director Ynon Kreiz, a former studio executive who joined the board last year, to the role of executive chairman.

>Mattel shares have fallen nearly 50% since Ms. Georgiadis took over, chopping its market value to just under $5 billion. The company’s annual sales have slipped below those of rival Hasbro Inc., which The Wall Street Journal reported last fall was exploring a potential takeover. It is unclear where those discussions currently stand.

>Mattel, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., and has 28,000 employees, has cycled through several leaders in recent years. A new CEO would be the fourth in four years. Like her predecessor, Ms. Georgiadis didn’t have experience in the toy business before taking the job.

>Ms. Georgiadis was recruited to join the toy maker in late 2016, as Mattel was signaling confidence in the looming holiday season. But Mattel’s inventories piled up at retailers and didn’t sell as expected, and the company had to cut prices to try to salvage the most critical period in the year. Sales and profits plunged as a result.

>Instead of inheriting a company on the upswing, by the time she joined after the holidays, Ms. Georgiadis found herself trying to stabilize what was then the world’s largest toy company.

>She continued to uncover more problems at Mattel. Before she arrived, Mattel leadership was trying to recoup more than $400 million in sales it lost when Hasbro took over a major Walt Disney Co. license tied to the “Frozen” movie and other princess dolls. But the slew of smaller products it turned to in an effort to close the gap added complexity and costs, and didn’t have lasting power. Some of Mattel’s other brands, like Monster High and American Girl, also slumped.

>Mattel continued to struggle last year as it tried to reduce excess inventory at retail and had to cope with the bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys “R” Us Inc., one of its biggest sales channels. Mattel’s sales fell 11% last year, its fourth-straight year of declines. The company reports its latest quarterly results next week.

MAC05-02,8dvn2k,Big consumer brands increasingly lack pricing power (WSJ),1524316133.0,118,161,"Consumer brands are competing with each other on store shelves and online, with (as the WSJ article below notes) the most notorious example being Gillette competing with Dollar Shave and Harry's.  That's just one example.  Of course other sectors have been always cutthroat (grocery), while others not so much (pharma)... so far.  In the blog intro to this, one exec stated the big brands are now all bound and no pricing.  With even more online comparison tools coming up , what effect will this have and will it eventually overtake other sectors (like pharma I mentioned before)?

Note I was going to post on r/economics but looking at what this will do for stocks (US and international) .... though general economic impacts are ok too.",0.89,"[""This is more of an economics and marketing argument, but the brands did this to themselves.  \n\nFrom the marketing point of view, the whole point of a brand is to work as a premade shortcut for consumers to understand the value proposition when making a purchase.  When brands had value a consumer didn't have to re-evaluate the materials of a product or its build quality.  This gave birth to *brand loyalty*.  A consumer would know when they bought Levis jeans they'd pay a moderate amount of money and get a consistent consumption experience no matter where they bought it.  The consumer had experience with the brand and knew how long to expect the product to last.\n\nHowever, the brands sold themselves out.  In a constant chase of more profit, Levis started making cheaper models of its product but still put its brand on it.  This leads to brand dilution.  A consumer can no longer know that *ever* model from that brand provides a good value proposition.  For a time this had minimal impact as the newer models were differentiated enough that a consumer would know as long as they bought their normal model, their experience would be the same.  Then Levis started making lower quality versions of their models sold at different retails such as Wal-mart *without disclosing this to the consumer*!\n\nWhile Levis might possibly still make a high quality version of their product, if the consumer can't trust the brand or even the model to communicate this information, then the brand name itself is not pointless.  High end fashion names with products made for Outlet Malls are another manifestation of this.\n\nYou can plug in dozens of top-of-mind brands into this same example to demonstrate that companies have diluted their brands to the point of irrelevance.  \n\nThis coupled with dominant brand continuing to raise costs without improving the value proposition have created the conditions to trigger consumers to search for substitutions.  If brands are now meaningless, then why pay more for a product that doesn't deliver a consumption experience on par with that higher price?

This has NOT been a good time for legacy consumer staples products for a number of reasons, some of which might be transitory some of which could very possibly not be.\n\nShort-term, I think the stock has been obliterated, is overhated and oversold. I'd be surprised if there's not some bounce near these levels. Long-term I think Kraft has to realize that it can no longer coast on its history and you have to believe that management can negotiate these headwinds.\n\nPersonally, I like CME.

Even Lean Cuisines have gotten better than they were 10 years ago, weird textured meats have for the most part gone the way of the Dodo bird.\n\nIf I can get an above average quality organic meal in the frozen section for $4, that's a reasonable value. If I wanted to take that for lunch every day it'd be $20 and I'd be set. What am I paying for? Convenience mostly.

There's definitely an argument that they're reasonably valued.  Hershey's is another one where I really like their core chocolate business funding their expansion into snacks.  It doesn't offer a dividend, but Hain Celestial is a really interesting candidate for a takeover in this space.  If you really want dividend yield, I wouldn't reach, but might consider Kimberly-Clark (3.6%) dividend, or if you're willing to take a chance on a micro-cap, Armanino Foods (3.4%), which just raised their dividend 12.5%.

KHC05-02,8cjsfz,Kraft Heinz - More Pros Than Cons For Long Term?,1523840589.0,19,16,"Pros:

- 8 billion dollar brands, 13 500+ million

- After zero based budgeting was done, they are the leaders in the consumer goods sector with ~26% operating margin

- Beginning to invest into other channels such as ecommerce, clubs, and monthly subscription services and investing into start ups and niche brands

- Very efficient after cost cutting, cut out older workforce and hiring younger millennials with a cut throat environment. Employees are compensated higher salaries out of the industry in turn for greater responsibility. 

- Currently ~4.1% dividend with a low payout ratio (more on that later)

- Approaching near book value. Additionally investing into tech upgraded warehouses/plants and have been getting industry awards for their creation of new, efficient plants and factories.'

Neutral:

- 3G and Berkshire make up majority

- Warren Buffett stepping down from board because of old age (although remains invested in the company, optimistic about future) 

- Possibly looking to acquire more companies. Not too interested in smaller companies but also not interested in purchasing completely different sectors. Interested in synergies and applying zero based budgeting (but much of the industry has been adapting to or adopting those principles)

Negative:

Low glassdoor rating, employees warn of too much accounting based focus. Ex: must print on both sides of paper, have to get key for office supplies, opportunity cost of time when scrutinizing every action over looking into innovation/ideas

- Millennial taste/trends shifting away from packaged food

Negative cont:

- Shrinking revenue overall

- A lot of debt after merger, a fair amount financed in house by Berkshire Hathaway

- Long-term sales questionable 

- Growing competition from store brands, private labelers such as Aldis (and even whole foods now), health conscious options competition on price, growing negative stigma towards artificial ingredients. Side note: While KHC has removed those ingredients from their product lines, I still think people associate packaged, processed foods with the name 

Ideally, I'd like to see them sacrifice a little bit of their margin to give employees appropriate supplies to work with although I agree with cutting excess fat, parties, unnecessary shit. They also make cost cutting economically inefficient when every last penny is focused on. Thinking about any expense under $10 stalls efforts on growth and the company does need to shift focus although their has been an effort to do so in the workforce they're hiring and being active digitally.

An example of the digital side is their recent Mayochup Twitter campaign. Unfortunately, the naming and some of their approach to it was forced and could be reworked but it was a good way to get free publicity and solicit direct information as to what some of their current consumer base wants. Again, a step in the right direction but with gaps to improve on. Their reach on the campaign reached over 900k votes. I'm intrigued by their lean approach to marketing. It's promising to see in house ideas/work get this large of a reach. Furthermore, I got curious digging to search employees with a digital background (as that's where a lot of previous center aisle traffic is shifting towards) and a lot of employees have high achieving backgrounds which leads me to believe their HR knows how to sell the prestige and success of the company itself. 

Overall I think the company has been currently hit hard after another quarter decline and overall poor year. I don't expect short term growth but I think the company is large enough to hold onto their current market share given their current efforts. If they continue with their digital presence and efforts in targeting niche consumer bases they'd be well suited long term. 

I've seen some discussion and previous threads crunching some numbers on their debt and based on their payment terms, must turn their revenue decline around within 5 years or else they will have to cut dividends at the very least to have cash which would obviously hurt long term and make this a rough hold but either way, I'd intend on holding it through thick and thin. However, on top of that, if Kraft was to continue with their current guidance on declining sales that would indicate a fair price to pay at around is ~$54 putting it right on book value.

Many of the old hands are gone, replaced by an army of recent undergrad and MBA graduates. It's great to bring in new blood that can work a spreadsheet and will stay at the office until 1 AM during the week and come in on weekends. The problem is that nobody knows anything. They have to run around like chickens with their heads cut off to find the answers to basic questions that could have easily been answered by older employees with company/industry knowledge. Don't get me wrong, the company is filled with smart, educated (and many times from prestigious universities), hard-working, ambitious young people. They just keep stubbing their toes as they work their way up the learning curve.\n\nThey have severely damaged relationships with distributors and retailers. Companies avoid working with KHC as much as they are able because KHC is full of assholes with more bombast than common sense. (Easier said than done, as many KHC brands are ubiquitous.) They continue to mess up billbacks, payments, and trade funds, which creates a ton of ill will and makes them look like idiots. They have had numerous cases of diminished product quality/defects and incorrect order sizes, although it seems like they've gotten a handle on that in the past 12 months.\n\nWithin the company, there was an implicit understanding that they would struggle with top-line growth while increasing the bottom line via cost-cutting. Standard 3G playbook. They have industry-leading operating margins, but they're starving future innovation to maintain those margin levels. Cutting costs is great, and there was plenty of fat to cut at Kraft in particular. ZBB is a fine method for doing so. I wonder if they have cut muscle instead of just fat.\n\nTwo more things about the employees:\n\n* Many of their employees are from an upper-middle-class background or above, which is particularly true of their Brazilian cohort. Many of their products (Jello, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Jet-Puffed Marshmallows, Oscar Mayer meats, Lunchables) target the lower end of the income spectrum. There is a profound disconnect between the consumers of those products and those that manage them. This is me free-stylin’ and is only my opinion: I believe this is a big part of why there has been such a struggle to connect with the brands and expand them.\n\n* Their total comp is heavily weighted toward their bonus. The base salary is nothing special, so the bonus is what makes their year. The problem is that virtually nobody on the retail side got a bonus in 2017 (foodservice got a modest bonus). All these younger millennials that were putting in 90-100 hour weeks have little to show for it. As a result, they're hitting the road. They can either make as much money elsewhere by putting in fewer hours, or they can go to consulting/finance to keep grinding and make more. Either way, turnover is incredibly high. There are a bunch of competitors that are benefitting from the exodus. Hillshire, Conagra, and Ken's are a few big ones off the top of my head that have gobbled up former Kraft folks, and a bunch of smaller companies like Pinnacle, McCain, and even Mizkan have hired KHC refugees.\n"", ""I'm generally staying away from food stocks unless some of them fall into really really attractive territory.\n\nGrocery is ultra competitive and will likely get more competitive as Aldi expands and Lidl enters the market. \n\nThe quality of store brands(some of which are supplied by brand names at much lower margin) has improved tremendously and stores like Trader Joe's and Aldi have stuff that's just as good as brand names for 1/3rd of the price. \n\nPeople do love certain brands and will stick with them(Heinz is a good example) but I think growth is going to be much harder to come by going forward as more and more people move to Trader Joe's ketchup or whatever. On top of that pricing pressure will drive margins lower too so I'm not overly interested in any food stocks ATM. If prices drop another 15% or so, I may take another look. \n\nAlso, cost cutting can only take you so far as eventually quality will drop and further push the move towards other brands. "", 'Pretty spot on.\n\nRising interests rates will not make financing debt any easier, and continued organic growth may only come by acquiring growing products in healthier product categories. As you note, this just adds to debt servicing or will put pressure on the dividend.\n\nI am not aware of all the brands Kraft owns, but it is pretty safe to say they are not dominating the internet. In the war of Amazon vs. Walmart vs. everyone else, Kraft stands to only have their margins put under pressure by either company. And only after that, will those same companies just push whatever gets more clicks/sales (often private label).\n\nSo yeah, Kraft will keep paying dividends, but might not be able to grow the dividend until revenue catches up to expenses.\n\n', 'one negative on the cost cutting - earnings have been maximised using the 3g method, there is no further margin for improvement.\n\non acquisitions, the sector is extremely expensive. it is far cheaper to innovate your way to growth, than acquire. however, zero based budgeting concentrates on maximising the profits on the things they already make, and seeks not to waste money on innovations / projects that may fail. \n\nfinally, i know it is mainly U.S. based, but they do sell some products in the UK. the brands like heinz are well trusted by customers, but many are weak.

Many of their products (Jello, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Jet-Puffed Marshmallows, Oscar Mayer meats, Lunchables) target the lower end of the income spectrum. There is a profound disconnect between the consumers of those products and those that manage them. This is me free-stylin’ and is only my opinion: I believe this is a big part of why there has been such a struggle to connect with the brands and expand them.\n\n* Their total comp is heavily weighted toward their bonus. The base salary is nothing special, so the bonus is what makes their year. The problem is that virtually nobody on the retail side got a bonus in 2017 (foodservice got a modest bonus). All these younger millennials that were putting in 90-100 hour weeks have little to show for it. As a result, they're hitting the road. They can either make as much money elsewhere by putting in fewer hours, or they can go to consulting/finance to keep grinding and make more. Either way, turnover is incredibly high. There are a bunch of competitors that are benefitting from the exodus. Hillshire, Conagra, and Ken's are a few big ones off the top of my head that have gobbled up former Kraft folks, and a bunch of smaller companies like Pinnacle, McCain, and even Mizkan have hired KHC refugees.\n"", ""I'm generally staying away from food stocks unless some of them fall into really really attractive territory.\n\nGrocery is ultra competitive and will likely get more competitive as Aldi expands and Lidl enters the market. \n\nThe quality of store brands(some of which are supplied by brand names at much lower margin) has improved tremendously and stores like Trader Joe's and Aldi have stuff that's just as good as brand names for 1/3rd of the price. \n\nPeople do love certain brands and will stick with them(Heinz is a good example) but I think growth is going to be much harder to come by going forward as more and more people move to Trader Joe's ketchup or whatever. On top of that pricing pressure will drive margins lower too so I'm not overly interested in any food stocks ATM. If prices drop another 15% or so, I may take another look. \n\nAlso, cost cutting can only take you so far as eventually quality will drop and further push the move towards other brands. "", 'Pretty spot on.\n\nRising interests rates will not make financing debt any easier, and continued organic growth may only come by acquiring growing products in healthier product categories. As you note, this just adds to debt servicing or will put pressure on the dividend.\n\nI am not aware of all the brands Kraft owns, but it is pretty safe to say they are not dominating the internet. In the war of Amazon vs. Walmart vs. everyone else, Kraft stands to only have their margins put under pressure by either company. And only after that, will those same companies just push whatever gets more clicks/sales (often private label).\n\nSo yeah, Kraft will keep paying dividends, but might not be able to grow the dividend until revenue catches up to expenses.\n\n', 'one negative on the cost cutting - earnings have been maximised using the 3g method, there is no further margin for improvement.\n\non acquisitions, the sector is extremely expensive. it is far cheaper to innovate your way to growth, than acquire. however, zero based budgeting concentrates on maximising the profits on the things they already make, and seeks not to waste money on innovations / projects that may fail. \n\nfinally, i know it is mainly U.S. based, but they do sell some products in the UK. the brands like heinz are well trusted by customers, but many are weak.

ED05-04,8dif94,Investing in a Home Solar Array vs S&P 500 ETF,1524174170.0,39,0,"I just finished getting quotes for solar on my home and trying to figure out if it makes sense from an sound investing mindset. In this post I will be ignoring the environmental benefits of getting solar as my electricity from the grid already comes from 100% renewable sources.

Assumptions:
Current yearly electricity bill = $2750/year

Increase in electricity prices per year = 3%

Solar array covers 100% of electric costs per year

I will sell the house after year 15.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Scenario 1:** Buy solar array outright. 

In this scenario I purchase in cash the solar array on day 1 so that I start saving money immediately at a rate of $2750/year with an increase of 3% per year. 

In this scenario I also invest the savings in an S&P 500 ETF with an average yearly return of 7% per year. ~~By my calculations this means I now have $53,704 by year 15 and $105,276 by year 25.~~

By /u/SirMontego 's correct calculations this means I now have $77,859 by year 15.

~~These amounts do not factor in the cost of the panels so the savings - cost of the panels is how much money I'd have in my pocket at the end.~~ 

This assumes the panels are of course worthless ~~and I lose my initial investment amount~~. I think this is a conservative ~~pretty sound approach as no one will be buying my used panels at the end of this~~. I also am not going to include the appreciation of my house ~~in this time as I'm not interested in selling.~~
&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Scenario 2:** Do not buy solar and instead invest the amount I would pay in an S&P 500 ETF with an average yearly return of  7% per year.

~~Depending on the price of the solar system sometimes scenario 1 is better and other times scenario 2 is better. Here are my results.~~

It appears solar is always better!

Edit: 25 year table removed since I'll be selling my home in 15 years


~~As you can see after 15 years I have not made more money but after 25 I have made money over the S&P 500.~~ 

I chose a wide range of install costs based on the quotes I have received after incentives. 

~~I have concluded that solar is not worth the investment over an S&P 500 ETF. My reasons are~~ 

~~1) I may not be in the house long enough to make up the difference and a lot can change in 25 years~~

~~2) Electricity prices may not increase 3% per year forever~~

~~3) Laws may change in 25 years that invalidate the solar economics~~

~~4) There are other hidden costs like maintenance to solar I am not accounting for as well as panel removal after 25 years~~




I really want~~ed~~ to make solar work. Convince me my analysis/conclusion is wrong.

New full conclusion coming soon. I will be getting solar

edit 3: Thanks to /u/SirMontego for showing me the errors in my tables. I'm now going with solar!",0.4,"[""Taxes, you need to account for the fact that the S&P gains will almost certainly be taxed when you claim them while the savings from solar will almost certainly not be taxed. Currently, total capital gains taxes for state and federal could be aound 30%, depending on a lot of things. \n\nAs for the calculation, you should be using internal rate of return for the solar to get a nice comparable percentage. Also compare that number with the irr number on www.solarpowerrocks.com to make sure you've not made a grave error.\n\nAt 25 years, the panels will still be producing. The warranty is usually for a certain level of production. Generally, production decreases 0.5 to 1% per year. Check the data sheet on your panels for more detailed information.\n\nDon't forget to consider the federal tax credit and any state incentives. \n\nAdditionally, note that state solar policies may change to hurt people who wait to get solar. For example, Hawaii recently said no net metering for new solar systems, but current system would remain under net metering. Needless to say, homes under net metering got a decent value increase."", 'Just wanted to mention that if you have a grid tie setup investing to cover your electricity bill 100% may not be the best approach. Maybe just covering an approximate percentage is a better approach? This would reduce upfront costs significantly and depending on your rates and electrical billing etc there will be a sweet spot.\n\nFYI : If you are installing a system that reduce sea your electricity bill to zero / negative and you are on a electrical plan which purchases excess rather than net metering. Then you would likely have a significant additional payment during summer months for selling excess back to the grid. Without net metering your system will likely be expensive if you are currently spending 2k+ on power per year as you will also be looking at storage assuming you want to use power when the sun is down.', '3&#37; increase in electricity prices is too high, it should be no more than 2&#37;\n\nITOT ETF is a better investment than solar panels', ""Your calculations for solar are wrong; do not subtract the cost of the system from the final number. Think of it this way, you have $15,000 in your bank account now. The only significant number is what your bank account will look like in 15 or 25 years. Just compare those two numbers.\n\nAlso, the internal rate of return for solar is around double the S&P's 6% here. \n\nLastly, if you sell your house at year 15, the solar panels will increase the value of your home's selling price.  Some sources say you may retain as much as 97% of your cost--which seems overly optimistic though. Realistically, I think 1/3 of the price at 15 years is something you can count on, especially considering that the 30% ITC federal tax credit is scheduled to drop to zero starting 2022."", ""I recalculated the numbers based upon a $22,000 system and a 15 year period (following the assumption that OP will sell his house after 15 years).\n\nPut simply, solar still wins under this worst case scenario.\n\nUnder the S&P investment, OP will have $54,893.89 in his bank account, which is what OP calculated.\n\nUnder the solar array investment, OP will have $73,547.82 in his bank account.\n\nI calculated the solar as follows:\n\n* $22,000 cost to install the system after all incentives\n* First year electricity savings is $2750\n* Electricity prices will increase 2% per year, but the system will lose 1% productivity per year. For the sake of simplicity, I just assumed that electricity savings will increase 1% per year.\n* Savings from the electricity will be invested at 7% and those gains will be subject to the 15% federal capital gains tax.\n* At the end of 15 years, the system will add $5,000 to the selling price of the home.  I feel this is a very conservative number.  The seller just needs to convince the buyer that spending an extra $5,000 to save over $3,000 per year for the next 10 years is a good use of money. That's an easy sell. But this $5,000 will be subject to the 6% realtor fees, so the number is really $4,700. Feel free to do a general internet search for how solar increase the selling price of a home to find a more specific number.\n\nRunning those numbers spits out a $73,597.82 number.  And that's OP's bank account will look like after an investment in solar. Notice that the $22,000 is not subtracted from this number.  $22,000 is what OP starts with in his bank account and $73,597.82 is what OP ends with. \n\nAlso, the internal rate of return numbers are 6.285% for the S&P (due to taxes) and 10.856% for the solar. Note the IRR number for solar does not need to assume the savings are invested because it accounts for the time value of money already.\n\nThis is a no-brainier, get the solar."", ""OP, your solar calculations are wrong.

> In order to produce the same amount of energy as the F-16's fuel, you'd need about 615,300 pounds of batteries, which would increase the F-16's weight by about 30 times, which means it would require even MORE energy to get the same acceleration, and so on...

- Some types of rocket fuel. SpaceX's Merlin engines uses RP-1 propellants, which is highly refined kerosene.

Hydrazine, another form of rocket fuel, is made using ammonia, which itself is typically made from natural gas, methane, LPG (propane and butane), or naphtha (also comes from oil/gas).

If there's another space race to Moon and Mars, it's going to take a tremendous amount of energy to throw lots of stuff into space, and even more when repeat launches are needed to replace failed ones (e.g. Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly, or payload failed to eject from the rocket). It's going to take lots of cargo to setup a base on Moon or Mars.

- Petrochemicals. I highly doubt the ""plastic-free"" movements are going to make much of a dent in plastic production and usage. There's a reason why many phone/computer cases, USB flash drives' cases, and cars' dashboards are made of plastic. There's also epoxy and some synthetic fabric such as nylon.

- Some composite materials. Carbon fiber can be made from pitch (typically comes from oil or coal), polyacrylonitrile (which requires acrylonitrile, which itself is made from propene) or rayon (uses cellulose, but requires lots of energy and chemicals to process).

- Fertilizers, also made from ammonia.

- Long distance shipping. Battery powered ships might become more common for short distance hauls, but sailing across the Atlantic Ocean takes a lot of energy, and I'd expect global trade to continue to grow in the long term.

- IF Africa's economic growth rapidly takes off, there will be a major demand for energy, similar to how much coal/oil China was using since late 1990's. But that's an IF, since Africa is overall a frontier market for a reason.

EOG05-03,8c1oa5,The proxy-voting season kicks off on Wall Street,1523645994.0,1,5,"JING ZHAO’S main occupation is translating Latin classics into Chinese. He runs a small think-tank, the US-Japan-China Comparative Policy Research Institute. He lives off rents from property bought cheaply after the financial crisis. But this quiet, intellectual California resident has a surprising sideline: submitting proposals to be voted on by the shareholders of companies in which he owns small stakes. That makes him part of a movement that is forcing management at some of the world’s biggest firms to consider not just profitability but broad shifts in social attitudes.

The annual meetings of America’s listed companies, usually held between February and June, have come to constitute “proxy season”—so-called because shareholders need not cast their votes in person. This year proposals from Mr Zhao will be on the ballot at four giant firms. He wants Apple to create a human-rights committee, citing its decision last year to bow to Chinese censorship by removing hundreds of “virtual private network” apps from its Chinese app store. For Twitter, he proposes a new committee to oversee issues such as human rights and corporate social responsibility. A third proposal would lessen Elon Musk’s dominance over Tesla by giving the board more power. And finally, he wants changes to remuneration policies at Wells Fargo, a big bank that faces fines of up to $1bn for mis-selling financial products.

Each firm has reacted negatively to Mr Zhao’s proposals. Apple and Twitter appealed, unsuccessfully, to the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) to have them struck down. So far only the proposal regarding Apple has been voted on, with just 5% in favour. But Mr Zhao, and others trying to use proxy votes to mould corporate America, are playing a long game. The vote has drawn attention to Apple’s concessions in China. And 5% is enough, under the SEC’s rules, that Apple cannot block the proposal from next year’s ballot.

Shareholder proposals used to relate mostly to corporate governance—for example, splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive. But in recent years that has changed. Even as the total number of proposals has fallen, the number relating to social and policy issues has crept up. Last year, according to the Manhattan Institute, a think-tank, more than half of those at America’s 250 biggest firms related to such matters. An analysis by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy-advisory firm—which advises fund managers on how to vote on proposals—found that of the 459 shareholder proposals submitted by early April this year, many fell under just a few headings: transparency about political spending, climate change, racial and gender diversity, and pay.

But that does not capture the proposals’ range and creativity. Campaigners on a dizzying array of issues regard proxy voting as an exciting new weapon. For example, this year the Sisters of St Francis of Philadelphia, an American order of nuns, got a proposal onto the ballot at AmerisourceBergan, one of America’s largest pharmaceutical distributors. Demanding greater transparency about the sale of opioids, it gained 41% of the vote. That is startling, given that supplying pharmaceuticals is the firm’s core purpose. The message to management is unlikely to go unnoticed. Two other distributors, Depomed and McKesson, face similar votes.

The Interfaith Centre on Corporate Responsibility, a group of unions, pension funds, religious groups and self-described “socially responsible” asset managers, published a guide to the 266 proposals its members put forward this year. One wants Amazon to look at how to cut food waste. Another wants Bristol-Myers to consider how to incorporate public concerns over expensive drugs into executive pay. A third wants Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to say how they will avoid violating the rights of indigenous people whose lands might be crossed by oil pipelines.

Early and often

Typically, proxy proposals are framed as being beneficial for a firm’s bottom line, no matter what the issue. That can stretch credulity. But it also provides essential cover for fund managers who may look kindly on a proposal but are voting on behalf of the shares they manage, since they are generally bound to support only proposals that would enhance a firm’s value.

In public, executives tend to welcome proxy activism. In private they moan about the time and money it soaks up. Seemingly innocuous requests for studies on an issue touch a raw nerve; each word could form the basis for future litigation.

It is all a far cry from the early days of proxy voting, in the 19th century, when the rise of public companies with dispersed owners made it hard to get a quorum. Shareholders were permitted to nominate a proxy to vote on their behalf. For a long time, their representation was mostly for show. In 1937 a jaded correspondent for The Economist noted that shareholders were merely provided with “special facilities for voting in favour of the chairman’s policy before they have heard his speech”.

The issue was included in the SEC’s original mandate, in 1934. But the agency has struggled ever since to decide who should be able to put forward a proposal, and what sort of demands it may entail. It took years for shareholders to gain the right to approve a firm’s choice of auditor, but such a vote is now mandatory—and particularly relevant this year. The collapse of two big firms, Carillion and Steinhoff, is provoking shareholders at some other firms with the same auditors, KPMG and Deloitte, to demand that they switch. ISS has recommended that GE’s shareholders vote in favour of dropping KPMG.

The current rules set a low bar for submitting a proposal. A shareholder must have owned at least $2,000 of a company’s stock for a year, and write a letter setting out the topic of the vote in less than 500 words. But getting it accepted is harder. Proposals are supposed to address issues that affect at least 5% of a company’s business, and neither conflict with its ordinary activities nor reflect a personal grievance. Management can appeal to the SEC to block a vote. According to the Sustainable Investments Institute, an advisory firm for social, environmental and policy issues, during the past eight years appeals heard by the SEC have been granted 40-60% of the time.

The SEC can be unpredictable and its results and utterances Delphic, says Heidi Walsh, the institute’s director. Last year it ruled that Exxon had to allow a vote on proposals requiring extensive studies of the risks climate change posed to its business. Over the firm’s objections, the proposals were approved. But this year the SEC allowed EOG, an oil and gas firm, to block a proposal requiring it to set targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.

If either side disagrees with the SEC’s decision, it can go to court. In 1969 opponents of the Vietnam war, who had sought and failed to call a shareholder vote to force Dow Chemical to stop making napalm, appealed. That led to the SEC ending its ban on proposals relating to political and moral issues. After a proposal in the 1980s to stop the force-feeding of geese was blocked, litigation established that a proposal can sometimes merit a vote, even if it concerns less than 5% of a firm’s business. In 2015 litigation by Walmart reversed an SEC decision to allow a proposal seeking to restrict the retailer’s gun sales.

The changing nature of shareholding has created some unlikely social-justice warriors. Shares used to be held in tiny lots by individuals. They are now largely consolidated into big public and private pools. That has turned sovereign-wealth funds, pension funds and the like, which vote in proportion to the shares they manage, into the equivalent of voting blocs. Private funds often used to neglect to cast their votes, perhaps for fear of antagonising corporate clients. That changed in 2003, when the SEC started requiring them to do so. Some officials running public pension funds seem to revel in their new-found power. Scott Stringer, New York City’s chief financial officer, made his stance on proxy proposals relating to diversity and climate change a big part of his election campaign.

In this new framework for corporate governance, the role of éminence grise is filled by proxy-advisory firms like ISS. It and Glass Lewis are the two best-known. They help institutional investors to sort through the array of proposals put forward by other shareholders and by the firm itself, and give recommendations to guide votes. But one voice is still scarcely heard: that of individual owners whose shares are held in funds and pension schemes. As social issues rise up the corporate agenda, it is a lingering injustice that they are ignored.",0.65,[]

MAR05-08,8ehjd7,"With all of the gloom about the oil/gas industry, what about the other uses for oil/gas other than vehicle or power plant fuel?",1524541297.0,12,5,"I've been reading about the ""peak demand"" for oil/gas, due to predictions of dropping demand of oil/gas for for cars, trucks and power plants. Although I've been wondering about what would be the demand for other products that require oil/gas, such as:

- Aviation (kerosene still dominates, and you can't build electric aircraft that can compete head-on against ones powered by turbine engines: https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-make-electric-aircraft-capable-of-supersonic-speeds )

> The kind of fuel you'd use in an F-16 has an energy density of about 42.8 megajoules per kilogram.  So, the 7,162 pounds of fuel stored in an F-16s fuel tanks contain 139 gigajoules of energy.  That's a large amount of energy for a comparatively small weight. (The F-16 itself weighs 19,700 pounds...)

> Compare this to a lithium polymer battery, the kind you would see in a modern electric aircraft like the MC30E.  The battery is rated at 4.7 kilowatt-hours (16.9 megajoules) and weighs about 34 kg (this is an approximation derived from similar LiPo batteries), giving it an energy density of 0.5 MJ/kg, or about 1% of that of kerosene.

> In order to produce the same amount of energy as the F-16's fuel, you'd need about 615,300 pounds of batteries, which would increase the F-16's weight by about 30 times, which means it would require even MORE energy to get the same acceleration, and so on...

- Some types of rocket fuel. SpaceX's Merlin engines uses RP-1 propellants, which is highly refined kerosene.

Hydrazine, another form of rocket fuel, is made using ammonia, which itself is typically made from natural gas, methane, LPG (propane and butane), or naphtha (also comes from oil/gas).

If there's another space race to Moon and Mars, it's going to take a tremendous amount of energy to throw lots of stuff into space, and even more when repeat launches are needed to replace failed ones (e.g. Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly, or payload failed to eject from the rocket). It's going to take lots of cargo to setup a base on Moon or Mars.

- Petrochemicals. I highly doubt the ""plastic-free"" movements are going to make much of a dent in plastic production and usage. There's a reason why many phone/computer cases, USB flash drives' cases, and cars' dashboards are made of plastic. There's also epoxy and some synthetic fabric such as nylon.

- Some composite materials. Carbon fiber can be made from pitch (typically comes from oil or coal), polyacrylonitrile (which requires acrylonitrile, which itself is made from propene) or rayon (uses cellulose, but requires lots of energy and chemicals to process).

- Fertilizers, also made from ammonia.

- Long distance shipping. Battery powered ships might become more common for short distance hauls, but sailing across the Atlantic Ocean takes a lot of energy, and I'd expect global trade to continue to grow in the long term.

- IF Africa's economic growth rapidly takes off, there will be a major demand for energy, similar to how much coal/oil China was using since late 1990's. But that's an IF, since Africa is overall a frontier market for a reason.

TL;DR: I believe the oil/gas industry might face slowing demands with some stagnation in the future, but it's unlikely to significantly shrink in size, compared to something like thermal coal industry in the developed markets.

Leerink say Mylan’s biosimilars/complex products pipeline is shaping up to be one of the strongest in the industry and should enable low double digit EPS growth over the next 5 years.

Tailored Brands Inc TLRD is a men’s specialty apparel retailer in the United States and Canada with brands including Men's Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank, Joseph Abboud, Moores Clothing for Men and K&G Fashion Superstores.  FY2017 saw impressive growth with 2.5% comparable sales growth and a 23% increase in adjusted EPS to $2.20.  The company also guided that 2018 EPS would increase about 10% to between $2.35-$2.50.  With the stock closing at $28.55 on Friday it looks like good value.

Naspers is a global internet and entertainment group based in South Africa but with the vast majority of its assets outside Africa.  The stock has an ADR listing in London and OTC ADR in the US.  The interesting thing about this company is it has a $155 billion holding in Chinese internet giant Tencent but has a market cap of just $103.1 billion.

TTWO05-16,8kgtfn,Thoughts on $ATVI with the release of Blackout and WoW Classic?,1526680365.0,16,16,"With the release of Black Ops new battle royal game mode and WoW classic, what are your thoughts on how this will impact revenue/stock price now and in the future.

Personally, I will be playing WoW classic when it is released along with a bunch of my friends so I anticipate subscription numbers to increase a lot since WoW classic is remembered by some as one of the most fun times playing WoW. Also with battle royal being the hot new game mode, $ATVI can use it's already popular title and it's fan base to utilize Blackout and get more players over to the game. Additionally, with the release of Blackout in October, this might be enough time for the hype of Fortnite to die down and allow for its player-base to consider new titles.

Thoughts?",0.76,"[""They're too late on the Battle Royale thing, there already is a well established and refined product on the market that covers most players \\(and for those that want a more hardcore experience there still is PUBG\\). \n\nWoW Classic will probably bring in some cash short\\-term \\(like the first months\\), but long term I don't see many people sticking to, what is essentially, a 12 year old game.\n\nOverall I personally see ATVI getting in some trouble in the short term, since some of its Franchises \\(WoW, CoD, Starcraft\\) are very old and attract considerably less players than they did in the past. Overwatch and Hearthstone seem to be stable, but it is questionable if ATVI can actually have long\\-term growth with those two.\n\nLong\\-term however I think ATVI is worth at least consideration. It is a company with great resources at its disposal, that has revolutionized the gaming market more than just once. I certainly see them sticking around and being successful in ten years from now, if they can manage to create new franchises or revive existing ones. However don't buy right now, wait for a dip like the one we had a month or so ago. \n\nThis is just my 2 cents and I am by no means an expert. "", ""It's too late for WoW Classic. They should've done that like 5 years ago.\nSame with Battle Royale, they're like 5-6 months late to the party and Fortnite has become so ubiquitous that the NHL is blaming it for bad hockey prospects! https://deadspin.com/an-nhl-prospect-is-reportedly-ruining-his-career-over-a-1826124656"", 'Bad company in a great business.', ""Company | Symbol | Price | Daily Change | 52W Change\n:-------|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:\nActivision Blizzard Inc | ATVI | 71.99 | +0.46% | +30.5%\n\n[*](https://iextrading.com/developer/ 'Data from IEX')*[13-Week Price Moves](https://storage.googleapis.com/echoapollo-assets/charts/20180518%2016h52-TIoza-linechart.png) -  quote-bot by [echoapollo](https://www.reddit.com/user/echoapollo)*"", ""I think they have great prospects, and its a great company, but I'm not comfortable with the valuation.  I owned them until it hit $55 a share and thought they were trading at a premium. shows how much i know haha"", ""I never played WoW so I don't know about that, but Old School RuneScape was a major success when Jagex release it.  I assume we may see a similar trend with WoW classic."", 'Predicting that Blackout will be a flop. WoW classic will be huge for a few months when everyone progresses through, then it will die down and have a small subscriber base.', ""I somewhat agree with some of sentiment here. I wouldn't go as far as to say 'bad company', but they could be run better, but their business they are in is fantastic. Wow classic could've came sooner, but it will still bring a lot of players for sure. OWL is pretty 'eh' imo so that is not a catalyst for me. \n\nThe good thing that they have going is their stickiness in their platform of products/games they offer all in one client. With that being said, it's funny listening to these analysts describe the potential influence this game will have. I spend a great deal of time revolving around finance, stocks, but still involve myself in gaming and probably always will regardless of where I end up. So in my opinion, these guys don't know what their saying and can say anything, it'll just be noise. As for what will happen.. In my opinion, the battle royale gamemode will very, very likely not 'compete' with fornite or pubg, unless it is godlike. People will not leave a f2p game for a $50 game of cod to play an alternative version. So in that sense, it will not 'compete' or take this growing share, although because of battle royales popularity, it is a good decision to add that game mode. \n\nOverall fornite will be tailwind for the gaming industry, but will bring a bit of a hiccup for some companies like ttwo for instance and probably atvi as well. Unless the next cod is 'pretty good/solid' and blackout is 'amazing' or 'maybe better than fortnite', it will have no influence in taking share. \n\nJust my 2 cents, but also the forward p/e of atvi isn't rlly high at all, so if you're looking to long atvi, I would think it is a safe bet, especially having passed this last dangerous quarter. Way I see it, in short; Gaming has been booming, and it is just starting to really kick off. 3-4 years ago with league to maturation of esports and then with pubg to now fortnite. The archetiecture is all there and the overall 'platform' of gaming is super sticky and fortnite is doing an amazing job at converting non gamers to gamers. People will eventually jump into new games, new genres and the overall industry will benefit. \n\nUnfortunately there aren't many stocks in gaming that I really like because like I said, for atvi, the company isn't managed that well and I don't like the management, hear a lot of poor things, but they are probably going to give the best return over ea imo, and likely over ttwo as well (although ttwo is way more risk with red dead). I would long atvi, not too much risk and solid potential return.  ""]"

[CRM and HUBS](https://imgur.com/MVoHPp2)

I have been looking at Salesforce (CRM) and Hubspot (HUBS). Both companies are in a similar space in technology. They each create CRM software and marketing software. 

If you look at the stock, you might think they are a similarly sized company. Hubspot is currently trading in the $110-$120 range and Salesforce has been trading in the $115-$125 range.

What the image above doesn't show you is that Salesforce had a stock split a few years ago. I know that must be a factor in how closely they are in value.

They just had earnings last week, revenue growth was down, but still double digit growth.

The stock has been up 31% in a week, two days of 7+% growth in succession.

In its current form, I don't think this company is comparable to Baba or Tencent, however it's a strong brand. What they lack is more of their own content, so it can be a problem to maintain profits (e.g.), and they are replaceable by other companies.

The CFO used to be CFO at Netease, which may indicate the direction Bilibili hopes to go. The CEO and COO come from Cheetah Mobile (big at selling Android adware).

> By midsummer, the board had concluded that Jacobson was incapable of leading Xerox. While he continued to talk with Fuji, they were interviewing replacement candidates. On Nov. 10, Keegan and Jacobson met in Westchester, N.Y. They talked amicably for a few minutes about the chairman’s recent foot surgery, then Keegan told Jacobson the board had given up on him. Although Keegan didn’t mention it, they’d already settled on a successor: former IBM and HP executive Giovanni “John” Visentin. Keegan told Jacobson to stop his talks with Fuji. But Fuji executives were scheduled to fly to New York a few days later. When Jacobson tried to cancel, Kawamura told him Komori “would be very disappointed” and might break off the talks. After reading the texts, forwarded to him by Jacobson, Keegan relented. Jacobson could go to the meeting, and they’d see where things went.

> And this one could go on for a while. Companies are more cost-conscious than ever, and the evolution of oilfield technology continues to make finding and producing oil quicker and cheaper in the pancaked layers of rock in the Permian. It now accounts for about 30 percent of all U.S. output.

Thoughts?",0.69,"['I don\'t know that WBA was a buy before this or that it has been for a while now. Even as of recently, the stock is where it was about 4 years ago. There\'s just a lot not appealing about it. As a customer, I\'ve seen prices at Walgreens continue to ramp and shop there less and less as the same thing is usually available cheaper somewhere else.\n\nMore and more OTC stuff is going generic at more and more places and people are more and more comfortable with using generic/store brands (Target\'s up/up Claritin $5 something for 40 at most stores; sometimes there\'s 30 packs, sometimes it\'s 40). However, the issue with that is that these products seem to be a race to see who can offer them more cheaply. So these products can be had for substantially cheaper elsewhere (Walmart, Target, Amazon, etc.) \n\n**As for generic OTC products, to use Claritin as an example lets look at the websites for Target, Amazon and Walgreens: 10 ""Wal-itin"" are $7.99 at Walgreens. A pack of 10 Up and Up generic Claritin at Target is $3.19. A pack of 70 is $8.49 at Target. 70 Wal-itin at Walgreens is $21.99. Amazon does even better: for a pack of 90 generic Claritin, it\'s $8.75. *300* is $12.48.**  Years ago, if you were getting close to being out of Claritin, maybe you ran over to Walgreens. Now you can order Prime and get it in 2 days. Or maybe you do Target restock and order the up/up brand.\n\nThe increasing amount of 2 day/next day options available to the consumer little-by-little takes away from the need to run to a Walgreens. Certainly not entirely, but enough.\n\nTeladoc and other services taking away from the in-store clinics. Now Amazon offering a pharma service so that people don\'t have to go wait in line at Walgreens. \n\nTo me the core thing that Walgreens seems to be focused on is charging more/way more than everyone else does for common stuff to take advantage of quick trips for things you need now/convenience. \n\nWalgreens has a lot of great locations, but if people continue to find less and less reason to go there, doesn\'t really matter. \n\nLastly, I don\'t think it\'s the answer but Walgreens stores are overdue for a facelift (and CVS even moreso.)\n\nAlso, earnings weren\'t that great either - store comps were down both in the US and internationally. The stock was up slightly initially after earnings, down a bit after people actually went over the earnings and then it cratered the moment the Amazon news crossed (and ended just off the lows.)', 'Saw the same thing with retailers last summer when AMZN acquired Whole Foods. All the big retailers took a big dip. Was a great time to buy COST, TGT, KR, DG, and many others. I recommend the same with WBA and CVS for patient investors.', 'what is the amazon news that impacted walgreenS?', ""Pharmacies in general are ripe for disruption. I don't see current pharmacies making moves toward leading that disruption, which makes Amazon's move that much more influential on the market.\n\nStories from pharmacists are that the job is terrible -- they are doing robotic work and expected to keep increasing the pace, resulting in mistakes.\n\nWalgreen's had a story this week where a pregnant woman whose fetus died was prescribed medicine to expel the fetus, the Walgreen's pharmacist refused to fill the prescription on religious grounds, and Walgreen's backed the pharmacist. There are going to be people on both sides of that, but a majority of women will be appalled by Walgreen's doing that, and women make purchasing decisions.\n\nOpioid abuse epidemic could also come down with repercussions for pharmacies, including costly changes to processes or even just a major scaling back of what was probably a profitable set of products.\n\nHealthcare costs are getting crazier each year. A company that disrupts pharmacies, which aren't really the problem but are extremely visible and widely used, will get mentioned in every political speech and talking head program for an entire election cycle.

In the past five years, the two biggest monthly drops in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks have been triggered by just such fears. In August 2015, China made a sudden change to its exchange-rate-management policy, sending U.S. stocks down 6.3%. And in January 2016, as China showed signs of slowing economic growth and troubles managing a burgeoning debt load, investor fears of a further devaluation led to a 5.1% plunge in the U.S. stock index.

>Omnicom reported a 2 percent rise in organic revenue - a closely watched measure that excludes foreign exchange rate changes and mergers. Analysts, on average, had expected a 2.3 percent rise, according to research firm FactSet. New York-based **Omnicom has been able to offset some of its large customer losses in North America with gains in Europe, where organic revenue grew 11.2 percent in the quarter.** Organic revenue fell 0.9 percent in North America. In 2017, North America contributed nearly 57 percent to Omnicom’s revenue, while Europe contributed 27 percent.

Not a big drop, but notable that one of the ""Big Four"" advertising agencies is looking outside of the United States for growth. Europe in particular could be attractive as WPP grapples with the demons in its closet, providing an opportunity for other companies to get former WPP clients.

Or, it could just be that Omnicom's domestic clients are not seeing as much value in traditional market spend, especially with the rise of nontraditional technology-based advertising competitors.

>Omnicom also faces competition from consulting firms such as Accenture (ACN.N), IBM (IBM.N) and Deloitte, which have built big marketing businesses in recent years through acquisitions.

Perhaps its just that these advertising agencies are finding themselves playing catchup to other data-driven advertisers.

NUE07-19,8t3w7m,Medium-long term prospects of American steel companies.,1529694148.0,3,1,"I have been taking a look at NuCor ($NUE) and US Steel ($X). Much has been in the headlines about Trump's steel tariffs, and he has gone so far as to tariff America's closest allies, indicating a firm commitment to the sector as a protected class in the economy moving forward. Some would say the back and forth on tariffs has made domestic steel a risk, but I believe if Trump has a firm conviction about any of his recent protectionist moves it is the steel, so I am ready to take a serious look at buying in to this long beleaguered commodity for the forseeable future.

Globally, steel prices have already been ticking back upwards, yet to reach their highs back in 2008. The tariffs will no doubt accelerate this trend, while also potentially disincentivizing China from continuing its program of state subsidized steel dumping, compounding the effect (the latter is my opinion). On top of this, from what I have read, home-buying demand in the U.S. is at all time highs while supply is heavily constricted, and builders are in the process of ramping up new construction, potentially leading to more demand for basic materials and steel.

I think the stage is being set for a serious steel bull run in the U.S.

With regards to these specific companies, from what I can tell NuCor is more diversified and cash positive with a higher P/E, limiting upside. So I've paid more attention to US Steel. They have been attacking their debt and should be generating positive cash flow soon. They have beaten 4 of the last 5 earning estimates, and are in the process of ramping up hiring. They have a new CEO hired in 2017 that I don't know much about, so that is a question mark.

I am finding myself in need of some direction towards my investing/ stock strategy. (simply looking to add capital to my name, no need for liquid cash for another 6 years at the least)

24M, with around 70k invested and a steady job. I am having trouble allocating the last 35k i have in my market fund with Vanguard. My current holdings are:

-VTSAX 35%
-Roth TSP (SP 500 fund) 30%
-TCEHY 10% (bought at $61/currently $50)
-MSFT 10% ($91/ $100)
-BAC 10% ($31.94/ $28)

I am currently reading A Random Walk Down Wall Street, and find myself contradicting its principles even though it seems like the right decision given my circumstances when it comes to deciding what to do with my last 35k i have to invest.

I am interested in JD, MU and V. However, the question becomes this......do i hold off (like i have been for the last 1.5 months), with the given news regarding the tariffs and chinas actions towards MU, or do i utilize the method of ""Time in the market beats timing the market""?

GE07-20,8tzbmu,"GE spinning off Healthcare, selling stake in Baker Hughes, focusing portfolio on Power, Aviation, and Renewables",1530013249.0,104,659,"> Sales and profits have been rising at the health-care unit, which accounted for about 16% of companywide sales, or $19 billion, last year. The business produces magnetic resonance imaging machines and other equipment sold to hospitals as well as laboratory supplies for biotech firms.

>GE plans to sell 20% of the division, the company said, and later distribute the remainder to its existing shareholders. The newly separate company would also assume $18 billion in liabilities from its parent, people familiar with the plans said. The division will continue to be run by CEO Kieran Murphy and the separation will likely take 12 to 18 months, they added.

>GE said Tuesday it expects to exit its investment in Baker Hughes over the next two to three years. GE merged its oil-and-gas business with Baker Hughes in 2016, leaving GE with a two-thirds stake in the enlarged public company. Those shares are now worth about $23 billion and executives have wavered on whether GE would hold on to the stake or pare it back.

>The Baker Hughes deal was one of the last major moves by former CEO Jeff Immelt, who led GE for 16 years and left last summer amid pressure to boost profits and revive the stock price. In addition to investing in the oil patch, Mr. Immelt doubled down on the power business by scooping up assets from rival Alstom SA and sold off much of GE Capital after the financial crisis.

CEO John Flannery told analysts he had “underappreciated the risk in this book.” My first question then was... what else from the Immelt era got swept under the rug and will come up as a surprise eventually? Why did Flannery so materially underappreciate the risk?\n\nI think strong management is often underappreciated and people don\'t appreciate the risk of mediocre/terrible management enough. Reddit\'s continual, ""but it\'s GE!"" doesn\'t appreciate the effect of Immelt\'s tenure and while people have said on here that they are confident in Flannery, as far as I\'m concerned there is nothing that I have seen that would provide any evidence as to why. Flannery was there during Immelt\'s time, he was there during Welch. He is part of the GE culture that lead to where GE is today. Additionally, after Flannery was announced, the market reacted: as of recently, the stock had lost about half since the announcement.\n\nThe best case for GE is that they apply a lot of financial engineering to the problem and either the eventuality is a break-up or a smaller GE. The smaller GE really isn\'t interesting to me. Some of the parts of GE are (the healthcare spin), but I\'m not going to own GE to own the spin and if the spin proves less than interesting after research, I\'m not going to be upset about not investing in it. I don\'t understand Reddit\'s continual interest in GE aside from it\'s something that people know and it\'s down a lot (the ""but it\'s GE!"" thesis), but the problem with that thesis is that it\'s not a thesis and doesn\'t appreciate the problems over many years that got GE to the not good point it\'s at today.\n\n\n\n', ""GE may recover eventually but will be a long term slow recovery Imo.\n\nTo me there are much better stock out there. I personally wouldn't bother with GE.\n\nWho knows where the bottom is."", ""Value investing means you buy shares that cost less than the value of their claim on the company's profits. It doesn't mean you buy stocks that fall in price. Having looked at GE's balance sheet and business plan, what do you think its earnings will be in a decade from now?  \n\nOf course GE would like its stock price to rise but that's not really something it can change by wishing and hoping."", 'I think a lot of people buying GE now because the price is so low (the shares are not actually cheap) will be disappointed long term.

They spun off their credit business at bottom and now $SYF is doing well.  They spun off healthcare of which they were leader in.\n\nGE needs to own multiple markets to improve its value and the fact is they havent got a true plan yet to increase value, mainly they are still shoring up things to prevent further bleeding.\n\nEdit - Thats not to say it cant move short term as the Industrial sector looks strong for next month pr so (ie $XLI)', ""Nearly half my portfolio is or once was a falling knife, so you know I make a habit of buying downtrodden stocks, and I have zero interest in GE.

Eventually. A really long time from now. If you see anything in it, you need a really long horizon for this one. So long that I can't even see how long. And it's still not really what I would call cheap even now.\n"", 'I’m sure every company is trying to increase its value over time. Your time frame may be too short for this play. \n\nRemember stocks are at their price for a reason and a cheap price doesn’t make it a value play. \n\nDid you buy GE because it was cheap?', ""You've invested into a company that chased out all of its decent engineering staff. GE = trash"", ""Yes they plan on improving their value over time. Their aviation segment still has contracts with Boeing and demand for Boeing's planes aren't going anywhere anytime soon. They actually have trouble meeting the demand for their planes. That at least tells me that their aviation segment will be bringing them in some steady income. Their power segment isn't going to be profitable until 2020 unless Flannery does something to bolster it (unlikely), and they're spinning off their healthcare segment (no I'm not happy about that) and selling their stake in Baker Hughs (\\***hits head against pavement\\***). They also have Ed Garden, one of Nelson Peltz's colleagues, on the board, and his activist investor bent is to break up companies. Will all of this increase value? Maybe. I think it will.\n\nYes, rot has set in but that doesn't mean it can't be taken out without some serious moves. Their call to spin off their healthcare segment was, to me, a sign that they're serious about becoming the strong company they once were. Yes Flannery was an uninspired choice who saw Welch and Immelt run the company ***but that doesn't mean it was a bad choice to pick Flannery***. I really hope they switch courses and stay with healthcare. This is a massive long term bet of mine. It will take a long fucking time but I'm in it for the long haul.

Opinions/criticisms welcome.,1530537603.0,24,15,"Traditionally I've been a simple 3 fund Boglehead type of investor, but after reading this sub and other material for the past several years I'm considering transitioning my Roth into a strategy that implements leverage and modern portfolio theory. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/430bn6/maybe_someone_will_find_this_useful_basic/) by u/hydrocyanide really started to change my view of risk and return along with following other professionals that post on this board, mainly u/MasterCookSwag, u/hedgefundaspirations, u/hydrocyanide and u/cb_hanson_III, so before I start I'd like to thank you guys for contributing to this board and making it a wonderful place to learn.  I am not an investment professional and therefore don’t recommend anyone following the strategies that I talk about without consulting someone who actually knows what they are doing.

The portfolio would be constructed similar to Larry Swedroe's ""no fat tails"" portfolio.  This portfolio invests 30% into equity asset classes that have a very high systemic risk (small cap US stocks and international emerging markets) and the remaining 70% into something like treasury notes or bills that would be inversely correlated to equities during times of crisis. By doing so you hope to eliminate the extreme left and right tail return events, both good and bad, and achieve a very reliable sequence of returns.  [Historically you would have achieved a very high sharpe ratio and even unleveraged would have a decent compound annual growth rate](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2018&lastMonth=12&endDate=07%2F01%2F2018&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=VFINX&sameFees=true&symbol1=VEIEX&allocation1_1=15&symbol2=NAESX&allocation2_1=15&symbol3=VFITX&allocation3_1=70).  

The idea of leverage always seemed distant because as a small investor it seemed too expensive.  However, I recently came across the [Direxion](http://www.direxioninvestments.com/mutual-funds?filter=monthly-leveraged-funds#!/) mutual funds that offer leveraged funds for these asset classes with monthly resetting (to avoid leveraged decay of daily funds) and an expense ratio (1.49%) far below what it would normally cost to use leverage normally.  [I was surprised to see that these funds were implemented before the financial crisis, so we can test this strategy through that very volatile period.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2018&lastMonth=12&endDate=07%2F01%2F2018&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=VFINX&sameFees=true&symbol1=VEIEX&allocation1_2=15&symbol2=NAESX&allocation2_2=15&symbol3=VFITX&allocation3_2=70&symbol4=DXRLX&allocation4_1=15&symbol5=DXELX&allocation5_1=15&symbol6=DXKLX&allocation6_1=70).  We see that over the past 12 years, using 2x leverage with these funds and annual rebalancing this strategy beat the S&P 500 with significantly less risk.

Caveats:

1.	This strategy absolutely depends on rebalancing.  Annually seems to produce the best outcome but I don’t have any literature based evidence of that.  I find it remarkable how much excess return annual rebalancing provides.  [By doing so, you outperform the best performing fund of the 3 by 4% CAGR!](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2018&lastMonth=12&endDate=07%2F01%2F2018&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=DXKLX&sameFees=true&symbol1=DXRLX&allocation1_1=15&allocation1_2=100&symbol2=DXELX&allocation2_1=15&allocation2_3=100&symbol3=DXKLX&allocation3_1=70)

2.	Along with point 1, the initial buy in is significant for a small investor.  The minimum purchase for each of these funds is $25,000, so you’d need at least $167,000 to have enough to buy in each of the funds with the proper allocation.

3.	Doing so in a tax advantaged account seems crucial.  Otherwise, taxes would eat you alive when you rebalance.

4.	I wouldn’t put all of my money into this.  I am a government worker and I’d likely keep my TSP money into the traditional TSP investments as a hedge.  Barring a market meltdown my Roth IRA should have enough to employ this strategy in a couple of years so there is plenty of time to consider alternate viewpoints before I jump into this.

Pitfalls as I see them:

1.	These Direxon funds are very small.  According to Morningstar they only have $8 million to $25 million AUM.  I’d worry about them folding shop with amounts that small.

2.	The volatility of the individual funds would be insane.  During the financial crisis the equity funds lost over 90% at one point.  You’d have to be a very stoic investor to hold to the strategy when faced with that, and it is easy to say you can do that when looking at the past.  

3.	The number of asset classes is admittedly low.  By excluding so many potential asset classes there is risk of suboptimal returns.  Something like the 7/12 portfolio is much more attractive in this regard, but historically it has been much more volatile and therefore not as attractive to leverage.

4.	This point is entering the space where my knowledge is admittedly limited.  These funds use swaps and future contracts to achieve their leverage.  As interest rates rise and if inflation ticks up what would that do to their expense ratios? It is 1.49% right now when money is still historically cheap, but what happens when that is not true?

NAVI07-25,91v6cz,US national debt & spending levels aren’t issues if you’re investing for the long term,1532548192.0,2,1,"The US Dollar is the primary global reserve currency and represents over 60%(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#United_States_dollar) of all reserve currencies held by other countries. The dollar is considered the safest currency in the world because it’s guaranteed by the United States. The Dollar is widely accepted for purchases globally. Countries around the world, like China have accumulated massive reserves of dollars because this allows them to create their own currency for spending purposes and its accepted by other countries because they know if China can’t pay its bills it can always borrow money, because dollars are a hard asset accepted everywhere even if its own currency is not. The US Dollar is called a fiat currency for this reason (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp).

Because it’s currency is in such high demand means that the United States gets to play by a unique set of rules when it comes to borrowing. The majority of the national debt is owed to either the Fed or the American public (mostly represented by their pension or investment assets). In this regard the national debt is a positive thing because it creates a safe asset for investors and pension plans to save in to help manage their investment risk while receiving a modest return. The US has only run a budget surplus a handful of years since WW2. The ability of the Fed to control interest rates means if debt servicing ever becomes a serious issue they can raise inflation thus decreasing the value of each Dollar (within reason given the economic situation at the time). Essentially the US can inflate away the value of the national debt over the long term as compared to GDP even if the actual dollar amount of debt never decreases. Each dollar is worth much less now then when they borrowed it years before. 1, 5 or 10 year bond means the government agreed to borrow that money from you for that period for an interest rate set by the market, interest is typically paid when the bond matures.

A far better way to examine the debt is using something called Debt to GDP ratio. It uses a percentage to compare the total national debt to 1 year of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The media will cite the current US debt to GDP ratio as alarming because it is over 100% of GDP, the highest since WW2. But debt to GDP ratio doesn’t tell the whole story, we have to look at debt servicing costs as well. You may be able to afford a $250,000 mortgage if the interest rate is 3%, but if it’s 20% all of a sudden a $100,000 house can become out of your price range because the monthly payment (debt servicing cost) would be so high. It’s true that the national debt has almost doubled as a percentage of GDP over the past couple decades. However because we’ve been in a prolonged low interest rate environment even though the US is borrowing record amounts of money, it’s paying less of a debt servicing cost today for twice the debt it had a decade or so ago. As long as rates remain low they can continue to borrow what appears on the surface like unsustainable amounts. Should the debt get to high and the market get scared it will raise US borrowing costs and force the government to cut spending and the cycle repeats, this has happened many times in the past.

Americans represent around 4% of the global population but own almost 40% of global wealth. The United States has a national net worth (assets - debts/liabilities) of $93.5 Trillion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_wealth).
How that wealth is distributed is a totally different debate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient).

In part this wealth comes from the US economic system which creates trillions of dollars per year in tangible wealth but also from its geographic location. This article expands on that further (http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/16/how-geography-explains-the-united-states/). The current global order is governed by an imperfect system of rules and laws that are enforced by independent bodies that each nation state is a member of (UN, IMF, World Bank, WTO etc…) , but for the most part functions very well. It allows for freedom of navigation for any nation to freely trade with another without interference from another nation (over 90% of global trade is shipping). This has meant global trade has prospered and no country has benefited from this more then the US. The global system is underpinned by the enormous US military, especially the Navy who conducts regular freedom of navigation operations around the world to enforce free shipping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_navigation#United_States_""Freedom_of_Navigation""_program).

The US is often criticized for high military spending but this could arguably be justified because the status quo benefits America more then any other nation. But they’re also picking up the tab. Countries like China and Russia are actively working to undermine the current international order. Corruption thrives in those nations and in a rules based system it’s much harder to escape justice, people like Vladimir Putin don’t like this because they like to play by their own rules.",0.53,"['>The US Dollar is the primary global reserve currency and represents over 60% of all reserve currencies held by other countries.

GM07-25,8vcxrh,GM says new wave of tariffs could force US job cuts,1530477977.0,29,20,"[Source CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/29/gm-says-new-wave-of-tariffs-could-force-us-job-cuts.html)

[General Motors](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GM)  warned Friday that another wave of tariffs being considered by the  Trump administration could force the company to scale back its business  and cost American jobs.

In comments submitted to the Commerce  Department, the automaker said that the tariffs, if approved, could  drive individual vehicle prices up thousands of dollars, stifling  demand. Such costs would need to be borne either by consumers or the  company.

Last month, President  Trump ordered an investigation into whether imported cars and automotive  components could pose enough of a national security risk to warrant  tariffs of as much as 25 percent. If he goes ahead, it would intensify a  global trade war that has engulfed allies and adversaries. In recent  months, the administration has imposed tariffs on imported steel and  aluminum, along with measures targeted at China.

Carmakers, in particular, have  been caught in the middle of the trade fight. They rely heavily on  metals to build their cars, including parts from overseas. The  president’s threat to pull out of the North American Free Trade  Agreement could also hurt the industry supply chain.

Several other automakers  and manufacturing organizations, including the National Association of  Manufacturers, BMW and Volvo, have also submitted comments on the  tariffs under consideration for foreign automakers and part suppliers.

“Increased import tariffs  could lead to a smaller G.M., a reduced presence at home and abroad for  this iconic American company, and risk less — not more — U.S. jobs,”  General Motors wrote in its comment.

The tariffs would result  in “broad-brush trade barriers that increase our global costs, remove a  key means of competing with manufacturers in lower-wage countries, and  promote a trade environment in which we could be retaliated against in  other markets,” the company said.

General Motors pointed to  other potential consequences, including “less investment, fewer jobs  and lower wages” for its employees.

“The carry-on effect of  less investment and a smaller work force could delay breakthrough  technologies and threaten U.S. leadership in the next generation of  automotive technology,” the company wrote.

A G.M. spokeswoman, Dayna  Hart, said that the company had no contingency plans calling for job  cuts, but that it was “something that could happen.”

“We are still assessing the impact,” she added.

FB07-25,908d5y,Zuckerberg's sales of FB stock since 2016,1532024483.0,53,86,"I kept seeing Facebook pop on lists of top insider sales week after week and got curious so I did some digging and I'm sharing here. This is just all of Zuckerberg's insider transactions (they were all sales) since the beginning of 2016. In reality, the dataset goes back to 2012, but he only had two sales before 2016 and it didn't make sense to squeeze the horizontal axis anymore for two data points. 

Anyway, I wanted to see if the privacy issues had anything to do with the dramatic increase in sales recently so I added some annotations of key dates, which I obtained from [this](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/) article. I have two charts:

1. [Number of shares Zuckerberg has sold](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR92E3KFA66LFXmNZE-609pgoJav1Y0m9K-FT5qJKT0JrJei55uUpPS89Id6BuWYNpTYdBFEvPnnS8A/pubchart?oid=1414172733&format=interactive) versus the price of $FB at the time

2. [Value of the shares Zuck has sold](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR92E3KFA66LFXmNZE-609pgoJav1Y0m9K-FT5qJKT0JrJei55uUpPS89Id6BuWYNpTYdBFEvPnnS8A/pubchart?oid=2001634303&format=interactive) versus the price of $FB at the time

Sorry for crappy looking charts, this is the best I could do with Google Sheets. Anyway, it gets the point across. Zuck has sold $4 bln worth of FB stock *this year*, and $6 bln over the last 2.5 years. The value of the stock that was sold is calculated based on the stock price at the time of the sale (e.g. this isn't what his stock would *currently be valued* if he still held it). 

Edit: the price chart looks weird because only the prices on the dates when sales actually took place are accurate. The prices on those days are just connected with straight lines. I could have used points instead but I thought this was easier to visualize.

FB07-25,929bc9,An updated Facebook (FB) DCF Model,1532664579.0,25,76,"Lots of FB posts last 24 hours, but hardly any real discussion; lots of anecdotes and emotional testimonies. 

Here is an updated [FB DCF](https://imgur.com/a/iuVBMRJ) and [PE model](https://imgur.com/a/X9SSiIg) I provided earlier this year ... Listened to the conference call twice, re-read the Q2 earnings slides and have updated every relevant item I can think of (and with, what i'd like to believe, a lean towards conservatism).  

One post recently suggested waiting until $140 to enter. Let's give some perspective to that price target ... using my model, the inputs that would lead to a $140 price would suggest -3.5% terminal growth and an 11.0% discount rate.  

Absolutely not even close to reality.  FB has a current WACC of 8.3%, and using a terminal growth rate of < 0.00% seems borderline mentally retarded given Zuck's history of purchasing growth (ie. IG purchase for $1B)

I have a $302 price target for 2022.  Given today's close, that is about 14-15% CAGR over the next 4 years.  Not going to make anyone filthy rich, but still a very likely setup to deliver alpha for years to come.  

Also, consider this:  FB earnings yield rose to 3.70% as of today's close (a company still growing somewhere between 20-30% YoY).

Who or whatever has pumped $10 Billion of fake value into this company over the last month or two is obviously insane.  GAAP earnings are being swept under the rug, and the accounting people are making up EPS numbers as they go.  

There is no justification for this kind of market cap ($110 Billion now?) for a company that literally has no appreciable assets, no reason for its customers to not switch to cheaper or better alternatives.  It should have flat to negative forecasting, not these baloney numbers it comes up with.  Whoever buys this stock as an investment obviously has NO EXPERIENCE WITH SOFTWARE.  Anybody who has worked in the industry knows: the more software you add to software, the bulkier and more complex and expensive it gets to manage.  You're not paying for the ""software"" you're paying for the ""service"" of waiting in line to get service.  Anybody using CRM is literally paying that company to manage its own unwieldy complexity.  Customers are paying what is probably a 50X premium for something that doesn't deserve a 50X premium.

On the balance sheet, its intangible assets are something like 40+ billion? That is NOT COUNTING SHAREHOLDER EQUITY.  Remember the accounting equation?  

""Assets = Liabilites + Owners' Equity""

The assets piece is being manipulated and false information is being presented to shareholders.  EPS numbers touted are not GAAP compliant; instead they are reporting past revenue as current revenue (accounting tricks), and forecasting future revenue based on that already false premise.  

Also look at its short-term debt obligations, which are already ridiculous (90-something percent of its intangibles).  And yet, it somehow manages to get way below market-rate loans courtesy of JP Morgan so it can do ""acquisitions"" of companies and pay the founders of those companies worthless stock.

FB07-25,8z436d,DD on Facebook (FB). I think it's a hold right now.,1531681383.0,12,6,"**DD - Facebook** \- 15 July 2018

The past 3 to 5 years, FB has increased revenues at approximately 50&#37; YOY to \~44.5 billion TTM as of March 2018. FCF/share has increased at an even higher rate of 100&#37; YOY the past couple of years. FB is increasing revenue and profitability at an extremely high rate which seems to justify its high multiples on FCF and earnings. As of March 2018, gross margins TTM were at 86&#37; and profit margins were at 40&#37; which is higher than its main competitor GOOGL (Gross margins = \~58&#37;, profit margins = \~14&#37;). This does not necessarily mean FB is more profitable as it does less in research & design spending, comparatively. FB’s operating and profit margins may decrease over the next few quarters due to increased spending on content filtering as a result of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The decrease in margins will be more clear in the earnings reports of the next few quarters.

It is clear that FB is currently profitable but I believe two things will make or break its future value: active user retention/growth and pricing power with advertisers. Currently FB has 1.449 B daily active users and 2.196 monthly active users on FB and this has been growing approximately 15&#37; YOY the past three years with growth in emerging markets. Can FB continue retention of users and drive growth throughout the world? Can FB drive growth on its other platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc? Can they monetize their other apps as well as their main platform? There was a recent Pew Survey from 31 May 2018 that reported only 51&#37; of teenagers use FB which suggests low usage among younger audiences. However, the same survey showed 72&#37; of teenagers used Instagram. These are all questions that are difficult to answer and certainly a risk if one invests in FB.

The second thing that will create future value is their pricing power with their advertising. The vast majority (> 90&#37;) of their revenue comes from targeted ads on their platforms. Smaller companies can advertise their products for as low as 1$ per day (for impressions). Pricing increases for greater user connections such as likes, views, app downloads, etc. FB offers marketing analytics and automatic targeting of customers to maximize outreach. I think FB offers an incredible service to small and local businesses to more efficiently market their products. With pricing as low as 1$ per day, can FB slowly increase prices after it gains more market share? Their biggest competitor is currently GOOGL and for the foreseeable future, these two companies will dominate the internet advertising industry. Currently, both companies do about 162 B in revenues and it seems certain this will increase in the future.

The other major risk with FB is increased scrutiny and regulations on data privacy. If nations pass laws that allow users to opt out of information sharing, this could significantly reduce FB ad targeting capabilities and ultimately reduce revenue. At this time it is difficult to  predict how regulations would affect FB’s profitability but it could certainly reduce user growth and pricing power.

**What is its approximate intrinsic value?**

To approximate intrinsic value, I will lay out 4 scenarios at 4-5 years out with corresponding intrinsic value and weight them for a weighted intrinsic value. FB currently has about 5.14 FCF / share (subtracting stock option compensation) and 15 $ / share in cash and short term investments. The current market price is 206 so it is trading \~37x FCF. Assuming FB will do \~6.5 FCF / share, it is trading 29x future FCF / share. In order to come up with intrinsic value of scenarios, we will use ratios such as revenue/MAU (\~20 $ / MAU) and FCF margins (\~33&#37;)

**Scenario 1: User growth significantly down, no pricing power:**

\-MAU = 1.5B. FCF margins = 33&#37;. Revenue/MAU = 20.

\-Revenues = 30B, FCF = 3.4 $ / share. Multiplier = 12.

\-Equity Value = 41 $ / share. Likelihood = 5&#37;.

**Scenario 2: User growth low, low pricing power**

\-MAU = 2.4B. FCF margins = 33&#37;. Revenue/MAU = 25

\-Revenues = 60B , FCF / share = 6.8 / share. FCF Multiplier = 14.

\-Equity Value =  95.2$ / share. Likelihood = 25&#37;.

**Scenario 3: User growth \~10\% YOY , moderate pricing power:**

\-MAU = 3.3B. FCF margins = 33&#37;. Revenue/MAU = 30.

\-Revenues = 100 B, FCF / share = 11.3 / share. FCF Multiplier = 17 (or so)

\-Equity Value = 192 $ / share. Likelihood = 40&#37;

**Scenario 4: Accelerated User Growth, Very High pricing power:**

\-MAU = 4B. FCF margins = 33&#37;. Revenue/MAU = 50 +

\-Revenues = 200B, FCF / share = 22.75 / share. FCF Multiplier = 20 (or so)

\-Equity Value = 450 $ / share. Likelihood = 30&#37;

**Weighted Equity Value = \~238.**

2) An alternative and more cost effective (fees) method to shorting is to invest in inverse funds. In this scenario you benefit during the actual downturn of the market and thus could be considered a short term approach to gain during a bear market. However, even if you profit during the bear market, if you're a long term investor you'll presumably now want to invest your recent profits back into the market which now has a higher barrier to entry assuming it has started recovering.

However, the issue with that is that these products seem to be a race to see who can offer them more cheaply.

EA07-26,902ivb,Is Nintendo's slide a buy opportunity? And a look at its competitors.,1531973051.0,30,15,"TL;DR: I saw Nintendo’s slide, so I decided to take a look at them and others. I like Nintendo, but am more skeptical of the others. Thoughts on Nintendo, Activision, EA, and Take Two? If you have anything that may help me improve or understand more, please let me know.

[Data here](https://imgur.com/gallery/yOLUtyo)

I am young and getting into investing, and when I saw that Nintendo has slid over 20% in 3-months, I was surprised. I decided to look into the basic fundamentals of Nintendo and some of its competitors, if only to practice stock research. I decided to look at Nintendo ($NTDOY), Take Two ($TTWO), Electronic Arts ($EA), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Zynga ($ZNGA), Konami ($KNMCY), and Ubisoft ($UBSFY) (Nintendo, Konami, and Ubisoft are international companies, so I listed, and mainly looked at, their ADRs). I also chose to ignore Sony and Microsoft because both of these companies are very diversified beyond video games, so I thought that it might skew the data, even though Nintendo directly competes against PS4 and Xbox.

For each company, I looked at their P/E Ratio, Current Ratio, and Debt / Equity Ratio. Then I averaged each number, weighted by market cap. I found that for each of these metrics, Nintendo looks good based on P/E Ratio and Current Ratio, although its Debt/Equity is high compared to its competitors. It seems to me that Nintendo is acting more aggressively than others, but that is less concerning considering how liquid they are. The average Current ratio is 2.64, and none of the companies fall below 1, which is comforting.

These are my thoughts after looking at this information and the 3 month & 1 year returns of each company:

I am surprised at Nintendo’s performance, as they seem very healthy and I don’t see any red flags on the numbers side. News wise, I can only assume that the slide is based people seeing a relatively weak E3 and a light holiday games lineup (though, with Smash and Pokemon, I’m not sure I agree with that). I see a successful new console, and I imagine they will continue to be very successful in the coming. In addition, according to MarketWatch, this year’s estimated earnings in $2.04 vs $1.24 last year. Looks like a buy to me.

For all of the other companies, I am surprised that they have all considerably outperformed the market. It has been a good year for video games according to sources like the NPD group, but seeing high P/E ratios, especially ATVI at 180+, is scary to me. On the games side, ATVI can lean on tentpoles like Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch, but I think that there is a real possibility that the new Call of Duty could fall short. I am not bullish on ATVI. For TTWO, I fully expect Red Dead 2 to do incredibly, but its release is definitely going to be a big swing for them. 2k games seem to be shaky, but will probably still perform well. GTA5 seemly can’t stop selling, as well. I think EA is in a similar boat with its EA Sports offerings, and Battlefield V should do better than Battlefront 2 did last year. These companies all seem poised to succeed, but I don’t know how long they can continue to climb like this.

That’s all I got for this. I really enjoyed doing this research and trying to understand it. Do you agree that Nintendo is a buy? Thoughts on ATVI, EA, TTWO, and the others? Again, I’m still new at this, so I would love to hear comments and critiques, I’d love to improve. What do you think?

ALK07-26,8wqq0n,Alaska Airlines Long Thesis,1530938941.0,28,29,"So I've seen a few post lately mentioning airlines around here and the other stock reddits and thought id share my brief pitch of going long on ALK from my reddit. Hopefully itll give yall something to consider. 

 Alaska Air Group Inc

**Alaska Air Lines**

NYSE:ALK

MktCp: 7.8B

**Core Business:** Alaska Air Group owns and operates Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, Horizon, McGee Air Services and some other smaller units. However I will focus on Alaska Airlines with consideration to the Virgin America acquisition since those are the biggest sources of revenue for the company. Most of their business comes from flights that transport customers to and from West coast destinations. However a significant percentage of their customers are connecting flights from West to Midwest/Atlantic

**Valuation:** Air Lines can be very tricky to put a price on. The business is very competitive and heavy on capital expenditures. Profit margins are consistently being brought down due to price matching other airlines. They naturally trade at low PE ratios. And historically have been value traps for investors. Therefore I proceed even more conservative than usual when constructing a DCF for this company. I assume that its free cash flow will grow 4&#37; on average for 5 years then reach terminal growth at 3 percent. This means some years it may lose fcf and others gain more than 4&#37; but I assume it will average out to 4&#37; yearly for the next five years. Using this I calculated a fair value of **$118 per share.** If my valuation is correct, ALK is very significantly undervalued.

**Competitive Advantage:** The commercial air line industry is all centered around offering the cheapest flights for customers and having small margins. Competitive advantages are usually either A) Niche Location or B) Brand Strength. I believe ALK has a strong case for both of these. The have a very significant presence in the West Coast having main flights going to Seattle to LA to Hawaii, even Costa Rica. The acquisition of Virgin America(although bad in the short term, more about it in risk section) will give them a greater share of the market in the region over the long term. Alaska Airlines has some of the best customer service and attention. They have had the highest customer satisfaction rate among airlines for 11 years straight(JD Power) and notable recent awards include best rewards program(Flyer talk 18), number 1 US Airline(Money 18),number 1 in Airline Quality Rating 2018, and ICCT Most fuel efficient Airline (2010-2017). I know some of these awards can be consider biased and some will say politics are involved but if you look at direct customer reviews of ALK and compare them to other regional airlines, its easy to tell that they have great customer satisfaction and its a priority to their business. To conclude I see ALK being a major player in a major market with an Amazon like focus on customer satisfactions.

**Risks:** Believe it or not, competition is not the biggest risk to Alaska Airlines. Oil prices and a recession are the biggest risks to Alaska Airlines as well as the airline industry. Oil prices make the biggest difference in profits for airlines companies. If oil continues to rise, airlines will have to raise ticket prices across the board. Higher tickets may impact the amount of customers willing to travel. If this happens and prices continue to rise, ALK's revenue,profits and FCF will take a hit. We have been in a bull run for 9 years(I argue less but won't talk about here) and its obvious we will hit a bear market eventually. Airlines are quite cyclical and a small recession will impact consumers spending. Much like oil prices, this will affect the revenue, profits and fcf for the company. They are also quite leveraged and higher interest rates could negatively effect their net income. A smaller risk is that the acquisition of Virgin America does not provide synergy causing investors to back out and lenders to be unwilling to give more money to ALK. The past 2 years have been rough. Alaska airline uses boeings while Virgin used Airbus which cause some operational issues. Management between the two took longer to become productive and internal politics became a bigger problem to solve than expected. This is clearly shown in the stocks lackluster performance over the past 2 years since the acquisition. While there maybe some rough road still ahead I believe management is becoming productive and the synergies will start to translate into earnings very soon.

**Dividend:** ALK currently pays a dividend of roughly 2&#37;. It is expected to hit 2.09&#37; next year. However I do not think it will grow significantly until after the synergies from the acquisition are realized.

**Future Trends**: Customer Service is more and more important as Americans have more money to spend. Considering the extremely low unemployment rates and the growth in spending power, It is reasonable to assume that Americans will choose to spend a little more to feel better. In this case it means paying a little extra for going from California to Seatle on ALK vs a budget ticket. IMO I think most customers will pay more for the satisfaction. As word of mouth continues to spread, more people will choose ALK over other West Coast airlines due to their strong brand and perks(free drinks!) The virgin acquisition strengthens their airport presence and with more hubs and more volume they should be able to lower prices while keeping their margins.

**Expectations:** Alaska Air Group stock is likely to continue its less than stellar growth this year. I personally have a price target of $70 by the end of 2018. Considering the summer months are the biggest for airlines, It has a possibility to get higher than $70 if they report significantly better than expected earnings for q2 q3. However we will have to wait until late this year, likely next year, for the earnings to stabilize and realize the synergies of Virgin acquisition. I have a price target of $100 by the end of 2019. And unless we have a bear market or considerably higher oil , I am confident in those targets. Although at they end of the day keep in mind they are just educated guesses and not accurate.

**Conclusion:** Alaska Air Group is a regional airline that has great brand strength as well as strong presence in their region. The stock has been lackluster due to some unexpected complications that arose when the acquisition of Virgin America took place. However I believe the complications have been solved and the power of the merger will start showing in the earnings soon. Due to the discount of intrinsic value to market price, as well as a decent 2&#37; dividend,ALK is a great 3-6 year hold with potential to double.

*Notes- Feel free to agree disagree , or even tear my analysis apart in the comments. Just keep it constructive and explain why. This is not a buy recommendation , rather its my opinion on the company.*

***Disclaimer- I am long ALK***",0.97,"[""I use to have Southwest and JetBlue. Made great gains from 2013-2015 but I'll never go back to airline stocks. Their stocks are effected by so many types of negative news whether it's about fuel prices, weather, trade wars, customer complaints on other airlines, overseas economies, a bad earnings report with a different stock negatively effecting yours...it's just too much. \n\nI believe a lot of airline stocks are currently undervalued and they keep building more cost effective planes that are always full of people...but the stocks still rarely trend up. Probably better off owning plane makers like Boeing instead. But even Boeing has taken a hit with all the tariff news this year. "", ""I want to play the short side for a second. ALK's biggest weakness is their scope. You mention they picked up VX to become a large West Coast provider and that there are synergies with the scope, but over 90% of their scope is still domestic even after the merger. This has its pros and cons but at the moment it's looking like a huge negative towards YoY growth. They have projected negative YoY revenue growth this upcoming quarter - along with every other domestic focused carrier. Airlines with more exposure abroad are doing stronger at the moment because international travel is up. Scope diversity is an ALK problem that the VX acquisition made worse. Also, airline customer service is a tough cookie to sell. Its been tried many times to differentiate on service in the airline industry but customers generally look at other factors like price, reliability, and connectivity over service. ALK has won a lot of awards but so has every other airline, the amount of awards given out to airlines is as ridiculous as the car industry. ALK's customer service differentiation is going to get harder to keep as they try to keep up with other airlines that are adding basic economy and buy ups which have proven to boost RASM and reduce CASM. They have already announced they are doing basic economy. As long as oil goes up, airlines will go down and vice versa"", 'Disclaimer I’m an amateur (at best) investor, but follow airlines quite closely. \n\nOne thing over the past year that definitely hurt Alaska’s profits was the ongoing pilot strike and shortage with Horizon Airlines. Horizon is a major feeder airline for Alaska and operates a ton of flights for them in smaller airports. Flight cancellations are an expensive proposition and this killed them for the first half of 2017. That was resolved but with a fairly substantial pay raise. The industry as a whole is going to have issues with the pilot shortage and I expect to see raises across all airlines. \n\nThe Virgin acquisition was a necessary move, but they also were forced to overpay as JetBlue also had a strong interest. Gaining airport slots, planes, and crews enabled them to grow significantly faster than they otherwise could have, but came with major challenges.  As you mentioned Alaska flies Boeing and Virgin Airbus, I think this will be a lingering issue for Alaska. Part of the business model that made Alaska so efficient and timely was having a single model of planes, B737. Sitting on a single model meant they didn’t have to deal with cross training employees or organizing the schedule around employees aircraft training, and sped up the time it took to ‘flip’ a plane, allowing for more flights in a day than legacy carriers could. IIRC Alaska and Southwest turn over planes on average close to 30 minutes as opposed to 1 hour by legacy airlines, which quickly adds up. Issues of crews timing out or cancelations due to sick or injured crew members are much easier to mitigate when all of your employees are interchangeable. This advantage was impaired by the addition of Virgin and their multiple Airbus models. The lease on those planes go until 2023 and they may need them all the way up to that point. \n\nAs far as long term views for Alaska, my biggest concern is competition with Southwest and expansions opportunities. Southwest expanding to Hawaii is going to cut down on the profitability on an already competitive market. Alaska has a considerable number of resources invested in Hawaii and has used that market to help fill many of its connecting flights in smaller markets. They also have to deal with Southwest expanding in California and challenging them for west coast supremacy. Southwest has been openly attacking them out west and targeting California customers in ways I’ve never see them do before. As you hit on, customer service is the hallmark for Alaska, and sets them apart from the legacy airlines. Anecdotally, people passionately love Alaska in a way I’ve not seen replicated for the legacy carriers. Unfortunately, Southwest also garners that same kind of enthusiasm. Their models are so similar that the advantage Alaska has when going head to head with a legacy carrier are mitigated versus Southwest. Lastly, I am unsure what expansion opportunities are available to Alaska. Slot restrictions at airports in the most desirable locations and the slow rate of airplane acquisition (slowed further by purchasing only one model) are significant hurdles to overcome. Going after the Midwest makes the most sense given their strength in the PNW, but taking on Delta in their home turf is a major undertaking. Expanding to the east coast or the south would involve setting up a hub there, which is an expensive proposition, in addition to taking on the legacy carriers established there. The southwest market means more time taking on Southwest. The best option to expand would mean another acquisition, The only two logical acquisitions would be Hawaiian airlines or JetBlue. Hawaiian would almost certainly be blocked, has even more route redundancy, and the same airplane issue. JetBlue, however, would be a perfect acquisition in terms of route network and business model. It does present the same issue of aircraft type that the Virgin acquisition did, however, at that point you could make an argument for having a primarily B737 fleet with a number of the A321 for specific routes. Unfortunately they are in absolutely no position financially to make that move. I hope that they are able to succeed, and agree in principal that they’re undervalued, with the merger and horizon strike tamping down profits last year, but I am not sure they can soar quite to the same heights (please excuse the metaphor, I couldn’t help myself)  you’re projecting. ', ""Not sure I agree that competition isn't a primary concern. Delta has really encroached into Seattle with new west coast and trans pacific routes. Even if Alaska still has a superior product, there's no way their yields haven't decreased because of this. Delta also has more leverage to gain lucrative corporate contracts. \n\nHowever, I do actually own the stock because imo the industry is severely under valued. Alaska, SW, and Delta are the best 3 managed airlines. Over the long term I think any of these 3 should have nice returns. "", 'In terms of growth, I think Alaska will have trouble competing directly with SW.  their target customers are the same and SW is the name brand.  Competition is good though, and if cheaper prices and better service are possible it will be good for all of us, shareholders included.\n\nTo challenge your assertion about well managed though: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sfgate.com/chris-mcginnis/amp/Alaska-Airlines-SFO-diversions-13004295.php\n\nNovelty is great, but even the threat of a bus trip in Bay Area traffic is enough for me to never fly Alaska again to SFO.

Fucking brilliant shit.', 'BTW The more detailed dcf price was around 110.

UAA07-26,8uthqj,Nike shares surge 12% to record high after sales top estimates and retailer sees 'return to growth' in US,1530282023.0,26,368,"[Source CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/28/nike-sales-top-estimates-as-retailer-sees-return-to-growth-in-us.html)

[Nike](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=NKE)  on Thursday reported earnings and sales that topped analysts'  expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter and announced a new,  four-year $15 billion share repurchase program.

The company said it saw a  ""return to growth in North America,"" which has lately been a sluggish  spot for sales following a handful of retail bankruptcies. Revenues,  meanwhile, were up double digits in international markets during the  latest period, as Nike reaped the benefits of a handful of new product  launches.

Nike shares jumped nearly 12 percent to an all-time high on Friday following the news.

The Oregon-based retailer  reported net income of $1.1 billion, or 69 cents per share, for the  quarter ended May 31, compared with $1 billion, or 60 cents a share, a  year ago. Excluding one-time items, Nike earned 69 cents a share, 5  cents ahead of analysts' expectations, based on a Thomson Reuters  survey.

Total sales climbed 13  percent to $9.8 billion, again ahead of a forecast by the Street for  $9.4 billion. Nike said its digital business alone was up 41 percent  during the quarter.

""Fueled by a complete  digital transformation of our company end-to-end, this year set the  foundation for NIKE's next wave of long-term, sustainable growth and  profitability,"" CEO Mark Parker said in a statement.

Part of Nike's latest  strategy to win back sales in the U.S. includes selling more directly to  consumers (thereby improving gross margins), making bigger investments  in women's footwear and apparel, piloting a test with [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) to rid the marketplace of counterfeit goods, and partnering with subscription service [Stitch Fix](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SFIX).

Nike has also been  focused on adding experiences to stores and scaling new merchandise. A  new React cushioning technology in its sneakers has been one big hit,  for example.

Nike's business — much  like that of its peers in the athletic footwear and apparel industry —  has been particularly stronger outside of North America of late. In  areas such as Greater China, for example, there's still more room to  grow. Retail bankruptcies in the U.S. (i.e., Sports Authority and  Golfsmith) have been disruptive for companies such as Nike, [Under Armour](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UAA) and Adidas.

During the latest  quarter, Nike said sales excluding currency changes climbed 3 percent in  North America, 10 percent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 25  percent in Greater China, and 13 percent in Asia Pacific and Latin  America. Footwear sales were up 8 percent overall, apparel sales climbed  15 percent, while equipment sales dipped 3 percent.

""Our new innovation is winning with consumers, driving significant momentum in our international geographies,"" Parker said.

Nike has been embroiled  in a #MeToo moment, with several senior male employees leaving abruptly  or set to leave Nike later this year, including brand President Trevor  Edwards. Edwards was expected to be the next CEO in line after Parker  finished his term, but he will now retire officially in August amid  complaints about his poor workplace conduct.

Parker has since  apologized to Nike employees in an internal memo for allowing a  corporate culture at Nike that excluded some workers and for failing to  take complaints about workplace issues more seriously, [sources familiar told The Wall Street Journal in May](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-ceo-apologizes-for-corporate-culture-that-excluded-some-staff-1525399012).

Nike's chief of human  resources, Monique Matheson, has also since said that Nike will make  changes to ensure women and minorities are better represented in top  jobs at the company.

Wall Street hasn't been  as rattled by the #MeToo developments at Nike. Some industry analysts  have applauded Nike's efforts to conduct a sweeping internal review of  personnel before the situation worsened.

""We are encouraged that  the Company is embracing change; both culturally and with progressive go  to market strategies,"" Stifel analyst Jim Duffy said. ""Against this  backdrop, we expect the Company shows strong evidence of firming  fundamentals that make more tangible capacity for the long-term  objective high-single digit revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth.""

Looking to the future,  Nike is more upbeat about fiscal 2019, building on the latest momentum  within the U.S. It hiked its sales outlook Thursday and now expects  revenues to increase a high-single-digit percentage rate, up from a  mid-to-high range.

As of Thursday's market  close, shares of Nike are up more than 34 percent so far this year,  trading around $72 apiece. The company has a market capitalization of  roughly $115.6 billion.",0.94,"[""I am making an upside of 47&#37; on Nike. And it's my fav brand.

There's been a lot of talk about the end of the bull run of the market, and my own theory is that since the market is people-driven, there's room for misinformation, panic and outright deception (cf. ""The Big Short"") in addition to data and its statistical analysis.  Why not keep an eye on what other people do, much as Google's search engine itself runs on a ranking system partly based on how many other pages have linked to it?

Here's the idea - flag when everyone else is panicking about the economy.  Looking at Google Trends, the peak search for ""Recession"" was in [January of 2008](https://i.imgur.com/cmHYlih.jpg), while the Dow was still reasonably high but wavering downward.  Hindsight says this would have been a pretty good predictor of dire problems, but then hindsight is like that.

CMG07-26,8ul7ck,Chipotle shares tumble 9% as company sheds little light on future performance,1530204640.0,52,55,"[Source CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/28/chipotle-shares-shed-as-company-remains-mum-on-financial-targets.html)

[Chipotle Mexican Grill](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CMG)'s  shares tumbled by almost 9 percent Thursday morning after the company  announced its strategy to revitalize the fast-casual restaurant chain  but provided few details on its future growth prospects.

""The call was lighter on detail than we  would have liked so we expect weakness in the stock today,"" Peter  Saleh, an analyst at BTIG, wrote in a research note Thursday. Shares  tumbled 8.8 percent to $416.89 as of 11:57 a.m.

The company [announced plans Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/27/3-ways-chipotle-mexican-grill-is-about-to-change.html)  to spend up to $135 million to win back customers and reposition  Chipotle as a lifestyle brand. The expenses will cover a new ad  campaign, digital investments to speed mobile and online orders as well  as the costs of closing up to 65 underperforming locations.

While CEO Brian Niccol told  investors he can ""easily see a future where Chipotle more than doubles  revenue to over $10 billion,"" he was scant on how that will play out in  the coming quarters.

""\[The\] conference call  disappointed in that it lacked meaningful near-term catalysts or fine  tuned financial objectives,"" Matthew DiFrisco, analyst at Guggenheim  wrote in a research note Wednesday.

Chipotle executives  declined to update or reaffirm earnings guidance set in previous  quarters. The only hint about second quarter results came from Niccol  who said positive sales trends seen in the first quarter had carried  over. Executives also said the company will book up to $60 million of  its restructuring charges during the second quarter.

""We are watching sales  and transactions every day and we look at it by region and by day part.  And what we continue to see is good performance in all the day parts,""  Niccol said, adding that he was optimistic that would continue to  improve.

Saleh said he believes  ""management is firmly on the right path"" to win back customers who lost  confidence Chipotle after a series of food safety problems plagued the  company beginning in 2015.

Niccol's strategy uses much of the same playbook he  used running Taco Bell — upgrades to technology and digital ordering, a  fun and witty company voice and new menu items. However, many of these  these changes are only in test phases or mentioned as long-term goals  for some future date.

Digital order pick-up  shelves, which are meant to prominently display online orders once they  have been filled, are only a prototype in a handful of restaurants and  its plan to add DoorDash delivery to its app is also in test, with the  aim of reaching 2,000 locations by the end of the year.

Its long overdue menu  changes are still in Chipotle's test kitchens or available in limited  markets. The company is trying out a new iteration of the quesadilla as  well as nachos, an avocado tostada and several frozen beverages.  Executives wouldn't say when they would be rolled out nationwide.

While the call ""focused  mainly on high-level strategies and did not contain many details related  to near- or long-term financial targets,"" Baird analyst David Tarantino  said in a research note that Niccol's plan should eventually improve  Chipotle's revenue and profit. ",0.9,"[""It's stunning how far opinion/interest in Chipotle has fallen.\n\nPlacement of newer locations near me seems to have a pattern -- high-visibility corners with terrible access and tiny parking lots.

', ""I eat Chipotle every single day since it's so cheap (I buy a sofrita bowl with double everything for ~$7, and keep it for lunch and dinner, which is about the same as what I would spend per meal if I were to cook at home).

- the dividend is already pretty high at around 5% and seems pretty reliable

EXPE07-26,8wclkt,Is there any Interesting Fund combining dividend investing + options writing?,1530813700.0,5,3,"Hey!

A lot of us know this dividend boosting strategy, when you combine dividend investing and selling options.

It seems promising but I have one problem - for this to be really **secure**, I need much more capital then I have now. Even with my frugal life it's gonna take more than three years with my current income.

That's why I'm thinking about Investing Fund. Do you know any? I think it should be good way to take advantage of this approach (IF, at least in theory, should be ruled by better and more exp investors than me) and what's more important - good benchmark to see if it works.

* Am I missing something or is this a no brainer to invest over the (FUSEX) given that (FXAIX) has a lower expense ratio and similar annual returns?

LEG07-26,90h4ay,"Here is my words of wisdom after reading Peter Lynch’s, One Upon Wall Street a couple-times.",1532101858.0,26,94,"*Misspelled the book title in the post so my apologies*

**One Up on Wall Street**

Here is all that I’ve digested in the past from reading Chapters 1-15 of Peter Lynch’s, One Up on Wall Street. It’s very dry cut but it has helped me out and I believe it can help newer investors!

**Words of Wisdom Chapters 1-15**

Stay away from DiWORSEification. Make sure a company isn’t investing into things it doesn’t understand. Find companies that focus on what they’re good at (niche).

You know stuff before the Wall Street investors. Possible stock purchases are in front of you. Look around and pay attention to your surroundings. Look locally. Try products. Get a taste when you can. Know people in industries and ask them what’s selling or doing well. Ask friends and family. 

It’s good to have the institutional ownership at a lower number rather than a higher number. As Acquirers Multiple would say, be different, Zig when others Zag. 

Just because a company works in one state, doesn’t mean it will work somewhere else. Sometimes waiting to see if their growth will be the same on more of a national level isn’t a bad idea at all. 

The investors relations office isn’t just for the pros. Get questions ready and studied, then make a call to the company you’re interested in buying. Two good questions. If unsure the good question always is, “What are the positives this year and what are negatives?”

Look at current assets and take the cash figure and add it-to the marginal securities. This gives you the total overall cash position. Socking away money is a sign of prosperity. 

Check the debt. Lowering debt is also a sign of prosperity. When cash is increasing and debt is decreasing is what we want. Our cash - debt is our NET cash position. 

It’s important to know what each product means to the company. How much of their profits come from this product? 

You want a PE ratio that’s half the growth rate. This is good. PE at twice growth rate is very negative. (PEG =<1)

Debt determines the survivability of a company. There’s two types. Bank debt and funded debt. Bank is worse because it’s due on demand. Bank debt is due sooner, also he can ask for it whenever he sees trouble. Funded is best debt. As long as interest is being paid, the business can’t be forced to immediately repay it.  

Dividend paying is good! Companies that don’t pay dividends can waste money on diWORSEification. Dividends create a positive aura. It also stops stocks from falling as much if they didn’t have a dividend during downturns. 

Lower debt is still more important than dividend paying. 

Book value understates or overstates actual value because a company realistically won’t be able to sell assets for as much as balance sheets show. But remember that the debt in the sheets will always, always beed to be paid. 

There can be hidden assets such as assets not being projected by interest gain. Company might buy gold at $500 five years ago. Now it’s worth $700. They will still show it on balance sheets as $500. That’s a hidden asset. 

Cash flow is amount of money in result of doing business. Look for companies that don’t need to spend as much cash to stay competitive. Cash flow needs to be looked at ‘free cash flow’ for this reason. 

You don’t want inventory buildup. Inventory growing faster than sales is a bad sign. Two types of inventory reports on balance sheets. LIFO AND FIFO ( last in first out. First in first out )

Growth is not synonymous with expansion.  Earnings is the most important metric for growth. 

Recheck companies story every couple months. 3 phases of a growth company. Startup phase, rapid expansion ,and mature phase (saturation phase)

First phase is riskiest, Where stock is growing and finding its ground. Second phase is when they are really performing. This is where you make most money) third phase is when the company needs to innovate to keep making more money.

Example is $ADR , the beer company. They own over 40% of beer market. They are a phase 3 business. They must find innovation. 

**FINAL CHECKLIST:**

P/E needs to be compared at industry level. Is it lower or higher? 

Institutional ownership preferably low!

Insider buys and buybacks are positive signs!

Are their earnings consistent?

What is their debt to equity ratio?

What’s their free cash position?

Have dividends always been paid and routinely raised?

If you’re holding long term make sure to check long term growth rate and how they do during market declines and recessions. 

Cyclical companies you must pay attention to the inventory levels to gauge what part of cycle they are in. 

Check for fast growers that their supposed enriching product is a big part of their actual business. Example is Hanes had a supper popular leggings company. Unfortunately it was a small part of their full product range!

Check to see if a company has room to grow. How does the PE ratio compare to the earnings growth?

Do they have enough cash to come out positive in a liquidation?

Big companies make small moves. Small companies make big moves. Look for smaller companies that are already profitable and have a proven concept. 

Stay out of ‘hot’ stocks in hot industries. Invest in out of favor, dull mundane companies. 

The ideal investments are companies with niches. Moderate fast grower with 20-25% growth are ideal investments. 

When checking depressed stocks. Look for ones with superior financial situations. Stay away from ones with a lot of debt. 

Look for companies that consistently buy back their own shares. Insider buying is a positive sign. 

A watched stock never boils!

Spend more time or as much time looking for a stock as you would for your own refrigerator

As an electrician, it may be beneficial to you if you want a broader understanding of how to open and operate your own contracting business, how to understand major market trends and why businesses do what in terms of strategic moves/partnerships/M&A activity, and it may help you identify and understand macro economic trends beyond overt things like amazon/uber=disruption and FAANG=good. all of these things, plus the added networking benefit, can be extremely beneficial to your future success if used properly.\n\nIf your only interest is learning stock market fundamentals, then you can find far more targeted and cheaper investing classes/workshops to attend. You don't need business school for that.\n\n "", 'Probably not. ', ""All you need to know about investing is Vanguard Admiral funds- and don't touch for 30-45 years.

MA07-26,8vy2le,Predictive Analysis of the Yield Curve,1530671415.0,53,62,"I usually follow the yield curve fairly closely (10 Year T-note minus the 2 Year T-note) as it is usually a good predictor for recessions. Utilizing regression models, seasonal fluctuation models, MA(200), and one of my most trusted models that I usually keep the p-value close to 95.6% on with a 2-4% error rate which doesn’t seem to matter much now that the yield curve is .299. 


When a yield curve goes flat or negative traditionally a recession follows between 6 months and two years afterwards. My models put the yield curve going flat or negative around mid November which should place the US economy entering into a recession between May 2019 and November 2020. 


With 2008 being a result of the banking industry utilizing Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and multi tiered CDOs I fear the next recession will be due to the renamed CDO the Bespoke Tranche Obligations (BTOs) and particularly the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) BTOs. CRE BTOs are filled with multi family housing loans. Unlike a CDO where you can easily monitor the default ratios of the underlying mortgages you cannot monitor the economic issues in a CRE BTO because when rents are high it is easy for the multi family housing manager to replace tenants with other tenants unlike a mortgage. So in light of that I fear that we will be more deeply in the muck when the bubble bursts because it is currently impossible to detect actually economic issues in the CRE CDOs and that puts me placing the actual next recession taking place in the summer of 2020.

I try to be as robust as possible so I welcome any insights or cooperative information. ",0.85,"[""The yield curve is useful, but I wouldn't put all your eggs in the basket using it alone.

AAPL07-31,93i7vs,"Apple (AAPL) reported its Q3 2018 earnings Tuesday, posting earnings of $53.3 billion revenue on $2.34 earnings per share. That beats analysts’ expectations of $52.31 billion on $2.18 earnings per share.",1533069668.0,414,1055,,0.95,"['Services alone is almost 10B in revenue now - crazy. ', 'Terrific quarter. Strong guidance. Not much to dislike. ', 'Thank god. If $AAPL missed earnings market sentiment could have taken a major turn for the worst after $NFLX and $FB', 'First trillion dollar company here we go', 'Great quarter -- Apple\'s moats clearly expanding. Here\'s my summary.\n\nApple posted strong fiscal Q3 results Tuesday, demonstrating the continued pricing power of the iPhone and the stickiness of the company\'s software & services ecosystem. At the after-hours price on Tuesday, it reached $995 billion in market cap and could shortly become the world\'s first $1 trillion public company.\n\nThe company grew its quarterly revenue and EPS by +17% and +40% year-over-year, in line with Wall Street estimates. Next quarter\'s guidance was also above estimates.\n\nMore important for Apple\'s future business and financial prospects is the complexion of that performance. Let\'s dive into how this quarter and management\'s guidance reflect Apple\'s two most fundamental moats: brand equity and network effects.\n\n**First, on the hardware front:**\n\nMany were hanging high hopes on Apple\'s flagship handset (the iPhone, which is 60% of Apple\'s revenue) and its climbing ASP. This quarter, the company delivered. The 41.3 million iPhones shipped during Q3 is basically flat from last year, but the average selling price of $724 is a notable jump. This bump is likely due to an increasing mix of the pricier iPhone X, which starts at $999.\n\nOur main takeaway from this robust pricing growth is that Apple continues to improve its brand equity and expand its pricing power. In a world of ever-increasing selection of lower-priced Android phones and already-high Apple penetration, Apple is undoubtedly seeing its iPhone unit sales growth slow. But the company is building digital services and a suite of other gadgets around the device. Those newer businesses, along with higher price iPhones, are widening Apple\'s brand equity and supporting continued pricing power and revenue growth. And pricing power, as Buffett often puts it, is the ""holy grail"" in investing.\n\n**Next, on the software front:**\n\nInvestors have been watching closely as Apple ups its software and services revenue -- a catch-all category that includes the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Pay, iTunes, and iCloud services. This segment has been outpacing iPhone revenue growth for several quarters.\n\nApple positively surprised with $9.55 billion in software and services revenue this quarter (+31% growth). We think there\'s still tremendous opportunity left for growth in this sticky, high-margin app/developer ecosystem. The reason (and the moat): network effects.\n\nAs Apple acquires more iPhone users from a hardware perspective, it grows the distribution channel through which app developers sell/offer their apps. This is great for developers because it widens their consumer audiences, and it\'s great for consumers because it widens the selection of apps, software and other services to make the smartphone experience more rich and engaging. As each side of the network grows in size, so does the value that each side of the network gets out of it.\n\nCEO Tim Cook said in January 2017 that the company hoped to double services revenue to more than $14 billion per quarter by 2020. That\'s almost 50% higher than Apple\'s current sales for that segment. Oh and it\'s a much higher margin business than iPhones too (because it costs almost nothing to plug a new developer into the App Store ecosystem, vs. the hardware that goes into an iPhone).\n\n**Finally, on the forward-looking guidance:**\n\nApple expects Q3 revenue to come between $60-62 billion (+23% growth), edging out Wall Street predictions of $59.5 billion.\n\nRecall that the company\'s recent quarterly results have been weighed down by concerns that it has saturated the smartphone market, marking the end of the iPhone ""supercycle."" The next quarter (fiscal Q4) is when Apple typically introduces new iPhone models -- usually in mid-September. Therefore, Q4 guidance is arguably the most important operating forecast that management provides to investors to gauge how the business and its product cycles will fare.\n\nThe company\'s strong guidance today suggests that multiple new hardware devices are coming in the fall (up to three new iPhone models). Per Tim Cook, ""we are very excited about the products and services in our pipeline.""\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\nOverall, our thesis has become even stronger on Apple. Similar to Warren Buffett\'s investment case, we believe Apple is truly a consumer brand at heart (vs. a classic technology or hardware company). Steady-growing consumer brands not only warrant higher prices and profits over time, but they tend to command higher public market valuations (given the predictability and secular growth of their earnings) than the hardware companies (which tend to be more cyclical, harder to predict and more susceptible to commoditization/price erosion from competition). At only 14x P/E on Wall Street\'s 2019 earnings estimates, AAPL is still too cheap for a growing consumer brand with pricing power and network effects.', 'AAPL stems the tide.

I ask this because I'm starting to get worried that $QQQ is being inflated by imposters like Netflix and that it's going to suffer hard in the event of a downturn, where Apple could weather the storm with their foundation. We all know Buffett has given Apple his stamp of approval but even that aside, the math checks out, and it seems like the stock is underappreciated despite their massive market cap.

I read somewhere it costs between $30-50 per month to charge an electric car for the average user.  According to a google search I just did that seems off, the average residential electric bill is a little over $100, so potentially selling 50% more electricity to select users could catch investors off guard and rally earnings as electric car adoption happens.

MAS07-31,8vy2le,Predictive Analysis of the Yield Curve,1530671415.0,53,64,"I usually follow the yield curve fairly closely (10 Year T-note minus the 2 Year T-note) as it is usually a good predictor for recessions. Utilizing regression models, seasonal fluctuation models, MA(200), and one of my most trusted models that I usually keep the p-value close to 95.6% on with a 2-4% error rate which doesn’t seem to matter much now that the yield curve is .299. 


When a yield curve goes flat or negative traditionally a recession follows between 6 months and two years afterwards. My models put the yield curve going flat or negative around mid November which should place the US economy entering into a recession between May 2019 and November 2020. 


With 2008 being a result of the banking industry utilizing Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and multi tiered CDOs I fear the next recession will be due to the renamed CDO the Bespoke Tranche Obligations (BTOs) and particularly the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) BTOs. CRE BTOs are filled with multi family housing loans. Unlike a CDO where you can easily monitor the default ratios of the underlying mortgages you cannot monitor the economic issues in a CRE BTO because when rents are high it is easy for the multi family housing manager to replace tenants with other tenants unlike a mortgage. So in light of that I fear that we will be more deeply in the muck when the bubble bursts because it is currently impossible to detect actually economic issues in the CRE CDOs and that puts me placing the actual next recession taking place in the summer of 2020.

FIS07-31,92vf8z,Virtual Reality Companies,1532877190.0,18,5,"I have a bit of a weird question and I apologize if this is the incorrect subreddit for this.  


For you to understand the question I have to give you a very quick backstory and explain my situation.

Almost 2 years ago, I got a new job that I very much enjoy and have started making a bit more money than I recently did. 

I've been trying for once in my life to get smart about finances so I made out a plan, started budgeting, read multiple books, and even got a financial planner.  To skim over everything, for the first time in my life I'm feeling like I might actually be safe and stable for a while. I'm very frugal in most ways, I pay off my credit card debt, mortgage and car payments have never been missed and I have a good credit score.

But for the first time with a bit of disposable income, I wanted to do two things: get healthy and set aside a fund of money for ""riskier"" investments, as a sort of hobby. I have done minor stuff here and there, generally been mostly basically broke even, maybe an occasional profit but nothing serious. But I'm always watching stuff and reading about them almost out of curiosity. Like a little game or challenge to see if your assessment and predictions become true or not.

So to get healthy I bought a HTC Vive. I heard you move around a bunch, I enjoy gaming, and I loved Sci-Fi movies and books and always thought the idea of VR was cool but it's been disappointing every time I've tried it. So again to skim over, I'm fully on board with this technology. It's fucking insane how much you move. There are some games that I literally can't play for more then 20-30 minutes. I added wrist weights to add to it and I mean it feels like a full on, better than usual workouts at a gym. Both cardio and muscle. It's finally here. It's not the end version, it's a couple off, but it's a couple years, not decades. I keep equating it to my brother this way:

Remember when we got a Nintendo 64 for Christmas when we were kids and it was like one the greatest thing ever at the time? We couldn't BELIEVE the graphics and gameplay of Mario 64. You look at that now, compared to graphics we see today, and it's laughable how simple they are. I feel like the Vive and Rift are the N64 version of VR so within 5-10 years, people are going to go HOLY SHIT, virtual reality is incredible. And it's not just gaming. They have educational experiences. You can do simulators to get over phobias. There are social functions like communities where hang out and chat. I played ping pong with a dude from Bangladash for like 30 minutes the other day, just bullshitting.   


So. To my question.

I am in no way wealthy, but I feel  secure enough that I'm trying to figure out if there's anyway to actually put in some money  into a technology that I believe is going to be literally one of those rare ""game changer"" technologies. I just can't fucking figure out how to do it. I mean would it be just investing into some stocks of companies like HTC? How can someone, completely on the outside, try to simply financially back a concept like VR but not a specific company per se? I'm just trying to figure out the most reasonable, rational, way that an every day Joe with a fair amount of research but for sure not an MBA or anything can try to take a chance?

Last week there was [talk](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/trump-reportedly-considers-tapping-emergency-oil-supplies-to-tame-crud.html) about Trump considering selling part of the strategic reserves to reduce prices.  This seems like an attempt to reduce oil prices ahead of the mid-terms in November given that many of the states Trump carried use a [greater amount of gasoline per capita](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-07-19/high-gasoline-prices-hurt-red-state-drivers-most) compared to other states.

Seems like we could be in for a large price movement upward between August and October followed by an effort by the administration to reduce prices (potentially selling some of the reserves) ahead of the mid-terms which give the GOP ammunition in the fight over working-class, Midwestern voters.

Several questions if I may, based on [investing.com website data](https://uk.investing.com/rates-bonds/uk-government-bonds):

1. Why is 1M, 3M, 6M is not updated live? - is that because there are no bonds maturing or are they just not traded..? Seems to be only at 7am...
2. This [image](https://a.c-dn.net/b/2fJbfd/GBPUSD-May-Fall-Bank-of-England-Set-for-Dovish-UK-Rate-Rise_body_UKrateprobability0.png) from yesterday's [news article](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/07/30/GBPUSD-May-Fall-Bank-of-England-Set-for-Dovish-UK-Rate-Rise.html) shows (same as above?) figure of implied rate and has (a calculated?) implied BP. I understand that Implied BP is effectively 0.716% out of 0.75% possible and thus 84% probability of a 0.25% hike, but how exactly is 0.6706 is converted to be 0.716%?
3. From 1M bonds [here](https://uk.investing.com/rates-bonds/uk-1-month-bond-yield), how can I calculate that Implied BP rate..? The bond matures on 20 Aug, so I assume it has X days on 0.5% rate (until BoE decision) plus Y days on 0.716% rate (discounted from 0.75 as not completely certain). I've tried to reverse-calculate, but just cannot figure it out. Any ideas how to do it?

These are generally used to build swaps curves. Your swap curve will not be the same as your bond yield curve.\n\nWith regards to how these numbers are linked - I am just looking at this for the first time myself - you correctly noticed that a 84.42% chance of a 0.25% hike gives us an expected value of 0.21605%, which I guess is the 21.60bp displayed. Why this only makes the implied rate 0.6707 and not 0.71605 I don't know, maybe someone more knowledgeable can comment on this? It's possible that the 21.6 bp is added over the overnight and not the BOE base rate to get that value.\n\n3) I don't really understand what you are trying to do here - you are mixing up concepts from the Swap and Bond curves which doesn't quite make sense. \n\nHope this helps somewhat.\n""]"

One of the things that my dad did for us when we were young was he opened up some mutual funds for us and would put any money we received as gifts in them for the first several years of our lives. I mean, if someone sends a $100 check to a baby for his first birthday, it's not like he's going to do anything with it, right? 

I never knew my dad did this until 25+ years later. It wasn't a lot of money that was invested and he didn't really feed into it outside of birthday, Christmas, Easter, and other random times we got money as young children. 

But when I finally received it, it had around $15k in it. I used that money to help fund my down payment on my house. He also set up another mutual fund for us, but I don't recall where that money came from. That one all these years later is worth about $11k. 

I'd like to help do this for my nephew (and also for future nieces/nephews and my own children probably too). It's something I never knew about, but was incredibly grateful for.

Technicals
Support levels, micro (15, 30, 1hr, 4hr) and macro (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
Resistance levels, micro and macro (same as above).
Trend (is it bullish, bearish or currently consolidating)?
Make sure to look at micro and macro scales
Mental stop loss (should be near the bottom support level on the trend that you are looking at). 
Candlesticks (what are they telling you?)
Volume (is there a lot of liquid in the stock?)
Float (how many shares are available to trade of that stock?)
Short intrest (how many shares a sold short, is a short squeeze possible, why/why not?)
Moving averages (where is the stock in relation to these averages?)
RSI (is it overbought or oversold?)
Patterns (do you notice any bullish or bearish patterns?) 

Fundamentals – can be found at finviz.com
Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)
Use within same sector to compare companies, compare it to the average PE of the sector
“What you pay for 1$ of company earnings”
Want the PE BELOW sector average.
Price to Book Ratio (P/B)
If the PB is less or equal to 1 (1>x), the stock is trading at/below the value of its assets.
If the PB is greater than or equal to 1 (1<x), the stock is trading at/above the value of its assets. 
Use this to compare companies within the same sector
Current share value ($) / (equity/share)
Price to Earnings to Growth (PEG)
Good to use on a company with rapid growth
If PEG is less than or equal to 1 (1>x), company is undervalued.
If PEG is greater than or equal to 1 (1<x), the company might be overvalued. 
Return of Equity (ROE)
“how well a company generates earnings”
17-20% = very good
20-25% = excellent
25%+ = superior
Debt to Equity Ratio
Try to avoid companies that have a ratio greater than 2.

Current Ratio
“the ability to pay short term and long term debt”
x>1 = liability > assets
x<1 = liability < assets
x>3 = holding back
SEC Filings
File 4 = acquired/disposed of shares by insiders
File 8/10K, looking for management optimistic/bullish

Financials
Income Statement (Revenues & Expenses, P&L)
Revenue = driven by price and quantity of the product sold.
Costs of goods sold = price of labor, materials, etc.
General and Administrative Costs = price of sales people, utilities or rent).
that takes you down to operating profit or EBIT
from there you subtract out your interest expenses (amount of interest you pay for debt) and your taxes (companies have an effective tax rate) to get to your 'Net Income'
Financial institutions like to look at a metric called EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization) which is a semi proxy for free cash flow
its essentially your operating earnings adding back Depreciation and Amortization which are non cash expenses
Depreciation (think of buildings, you have a building worth $100 and you depreciate it over 5 years so goes down by $20 every year but its not a true expense so you add it back
Amortization is for intangibles think like Intellectual Property
Balance Sheet (Financial position at a given point in time)
Balance Sheet (financial position at point in time). Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity
That's the very definition
On the Assets side, you have Cash and equivalents (could be short-term treasuries that you can convert to cash pretty quickly usually within a year), Accounts Receivable (what a client owes you in credit), Inventory, PP&E (think like machinery for industrial companies). Liabilities is primarily A/P (what you owe ), Debt, both short and long term among others
then Owner's equity is Common Stock, Retained Earnings (Net Income - Dividends paid to date) flows from Net Income on income statement
Cash Flow Statement (cash flow from operations, financing and operations)
Cash Flow Statement, 3 main ones are Cash Flow from Operations (pretty straightforward what this means, day-to-day cash outflows/inflows)
Cash Flow from Investing (CapEX is the big one here, represents purchase and sale of equipment, plant, properties, etc.) also outflows from acquisitions or inflows from sales show up here
Cash Flow from Financing is how the company raises money, you issue stock, you issue debt, and you get money
companies can also repurchase their stock to lower number of shares outstanding, shows confidence in the stock

**One Up on Wall Street**

Here is all that I’ve digested in the past from reading Chapters 1-15 of Peter Lynch’s, One Up on Wall Street. It’s very dry cut but it has helped me out and I believe it can help newer investors!

**Words of Wisdom Chapters 1-15**

Stay away from DiWORSEification. Make sure a company isn’t investing into things it doesn’t understand. Find companies that focus on what they’re good at (niche).

You know stuff before the Wall Street investors. Possible stock purchases are in front of you. Look around and pay attention to your surroundings. Look locally. Try products. Get a taste when you can. Know people in industries and ask them what’s selling or doing well. Ask friends and family. 

It’s good to have the institutional ownership at a lower number rather than a higher number. As Acquirers Multiple would say, be different, Zig when others Zag. 

Just because a company works in one state, doesn’t mean it will work somewhere else. Sometimes waiting to see if their growth will be the same on more of a national level isn’t a bad idea at all. 

The investors relations office isn’t just for the pros. Get questions ready and studied, then make a call to the company you’re interested in buying. Two good questions. If unsure the good question always is, “What are the positives this year and what are negatives?”

Look at current assets and take the cash figure and add it-to the marginal securities. This gives you the total overall cash position. Socking away money is a sign of prosperity. 

Check the debt. Lowering debt is also a sign of prosperity. When cash is increasing and debt is decreasing is what we want. Our cash - debt is our NET cash position. 

It’s important to know what each product means to the company. How much of their profits come from this product? 

You want a PE ratio that’s half the growth rate. This is good. PE at twice growth rate is very negative. (PEG =<1)

Debt determines the survivability of a company. There’s two types. Bank debt and funded debt. Bank is worse because it’s due on demand. Bank debt is due sooner, also he can ask for it whenever he sees trouble. Funded is best debt. As long as interest is being paid, the business can’t be forced to immediately repay it.  

Dividend paying is good! Companies that don’t pay dividends can waste money on diWORSEification. Dividends create a positive aura. It also stops stocks from falling as much if they didn’t have a dividend during downturns. 

Lower debt is still more important than dividend paying. 

Book value understates or overstates actual value because a company realistically won’t be able to sell assets for as much as balance sheets show. But remember that the debt in the sheets will always, always beed to be paid. 

There can be hidden assets such as assets not being projected by interest gain. Company might buy gold at $500 five years ago. Now it’s worth $700. They will still show it on balance sheets as $500. That’s a hidden asset. 

Cash flow is amount of money in result of doing business. Look for companies that don’t need to spend as much cash to stay competitive. Cash flow needs to be looked at ‘free cash flow’ for this reason. 

You don’t want inventory buildup. Inventory growing faster than sales is a bad sign. Two types of inventory reports on balance sheets. LIFO AND FIFO ( last in first out. First in first out )

Growth is not synonymous with expansion.  Earnings is the most important metric for growth. 

Recheck companies story every couple months. 3 phases of a growth company. Startup phase, rapid expansion ,and mature phase (saturation phase)

First phase is riskiest, Where stock is growing and finding its ground. Second phase is when they are really performing. This is where you make most money) third phase is when the company needs to innovate to keep making more money.

Example is $ADR , the beer company. They own over 40% of beer market. They are a phase 3 business. They must find innovation. 

**FINAL CHECKLIST:**

P/E needs to be compared at industry level. Is it lower or higher? 

Institutional ownership preferably low!

Insider buys and buybacks are positive signs!

Are their earnings consistent?

What is their debt to equity ratio?

What’s their free cash position?

Have dividends always been paid and routinely raised?

If you’re holding long term make sure to check long term growth rate and how they do during market declines and recessions. 

Cyclical companies you must pay attention to the inventory levels to gauge what part of cycle they are in. 

Check for fast growers that their supposed enriching product is a big part of their actual business. Example is Hanes had a supper popular leggings company. Unfortunately it was a small part of their full product range!

Check to see if a company has room to grow. How does the PE ratio compare to the earnings growth?

Do they have enough cash to come out positive in a liquidation?

Big companies make small moves. Small companies make big moves. Look for smaller companies that are already profitable and have a proven concept. 

Stay out of ‘hot’ stocks in hot industries. Invest in out of favor, dull mundane companies. 

The ideal investments are companies with niches. Moderate fast grower with 20-25% growth are ideal investments. 

When checking depressed stocks. Look for ones with superior financial situations. Stay away from ones with a lot of debt. 

Look for companies that consistently buy back their own shares. Insider buying is a positive sign. 

A watched stock never boils!

2. Top players listed in the US are Yirendai (YRD), Hexindai (HX), Qudian (QD), LexinFintech (LX)
3. The government has been regulating the consumer lending market in China and this has resulted in several fraudulent companies being shut down (around 4k companies shut down in 2017)
4. Govt is also capping the interest rates being charged by the investors. This has resulted in investors withdrawing from the platforms as they see better opportunities elsewhere
5. Defaults are also growing as the industry expands and the average risk level of the borrower goes up
6. Questions have also been raised on the financial audits of the listed players
7. All of this has resulted in 50-60% decline stock prices over the past 4-5 months, leading to extremely low P/E, PEG levels on account of high growth rates, high margins

HUM08-01,90giq4,Why Isn't the Threat of a Massive Trade War not Affecting Markets?,1532097475.0,39,14,"Tariffs cause prices to rise. That's what they're intended for. The hope is higher prices will offset a perceived unfair trade practice. Historically the stock market reacted badly to increased trade restrictions. President Reagan used more open trade as a way of lowering inflation and invigorating the economy.

A pissing contest with China has serious risks (see CNBC article I link below). So far China has allowed its currency to devalue, virtually nullifying the U.S. tariffs while making all U.S. goods more expensive in China. This hurts, not helps, the economy.

China also holds a huge club. With north of $1 trillion in Treasuries, China could stop buying new U.S. debt or even sell. This would cause either higher interest rates or, if the Fed buys up all the excess Treasuries on the market, cause seriously higher inflation.

Every time Trump increases the trade rhetoric the market declines slightly, only to recover later as if nothing happened.

I'm interested in what people think about the evolving trade war. Will it continue expanding? At what point does it bite? American farmers are hurting bad (my dad is in the agricultural repair business and says its as bad as the early 1980s or worse).

With the economy humming along, why do we need to spike the economy? Tax cuts (I like them, but they might have been deployed better in a soft economy) and trade friction meant to increase U.S. economic vibrancy when there are so few available workers seems foolish to me. People say they want to retire as early as possible and then demand(?) more work? I don't get it.

CNBC has another good article on the trade issues with China. I'm interested in comment from outside the traditional media outlets. I see farmers suffering and less than happy they are the scapegoats in the trade war. Is anyone really willing to take one on the chin for a trade war when economically things are going so well? Is the industry you're working in feeling any affect from the trade disputes?

MET08-01,93p3j4,What I absorbed from my mistakes,1533131267.0,51,192,"I had been deliberating initiation of a post discussing mistakes.
I’ve tried and recalled by mistakes, errors of judgement in my short exposure to capital markets. I'm a resident of India. Hence, some terms may seem foreign. Please bear with me.



Lesson 1:
I started taking a keen interest in markets in 2012.
My trading and investment decisions were based on stock recommendations offered by analysts on TV channels.

The returns generated were decent. I truly wondered why people thought trading/investing was difficult. I thought I had discovered the recipe for success in stock markets. It was easy. It required little effort from my end. All I had to do was imitate the analyst’s stock pick.


My condition was great. Until one day. The stock picks recommended for intraday started failing. It was unfathomable to me that I was losing so much money. I resorted to revenge trading. Lost even more money.


Whatever profits I had generated were evaporated in a relatively short duration. I could’ve never imagined such an outcome.
In hindsight I should’ve thought that there’s never a free lunch. Why would anyone offer their stock picks without anything in return?

Lesson: Trust no one blindly. Assess, examine trading/ investment decisions.

Every action of assistance, guidance towards us in the stock market should be looked at with glasses of cynicism. It’s a brutal place.



Lesson 2:
On a popular stock app there’s a bustling interaction medium. Stock picks are often offered for free and people wax eloquent about the tremendous potential the company possesses to multiply our wealth.


I came across one such message recommending investment in an investment company. It’d be inappropriate to share the stock pick.


The stock was described as being at the cusp of a great transition to being a large cap company. Messages loaded with superlatives describing the management bombarded the board. It seemed like the ideal investment opportunity.


I trusted them and invested 10 % of my portfolio.
The stock went from X to 3X in 5 months.
My happiness knew no bounds. I was ecstatic.
I continued averaging at upper levels expecting even more upside.


One day, the stock began its downward slide. Lower circuit after lower circuit. Surveillance measures were taken by the exchange and moved to 5% circuit. The fall was excruciating. It stopped when it reached 1.5 X.


I continued to average. Since, I had purchased heavily at upper levels my average price became very high. Losses incurred were significant. The fall wasn’t arrested yet. It kept falling. The stock formed 35% of my portfolio.


My portfolio was painted in red. There was little chance the stock would regain its past glory. I had to book my losses. It dawned on me that the stock move was a meticulously engineered operation by bigger investors.
 I had invested by trusting someone else.


Summary of Lesson 2: If possible avoid excessive concentration in any stock pick. Conditions can deteriorate at any point.
Introduce adequate safeguards to protect profits.


Booking profits will reduce cost of carry.
It was my greed that destroyed my portfolio.
It’s difficult to tame greed but those who succeeed at doing so will likely emerge victorious in the market.




Lesson 3:
In 2016, I came across a petrochemical company which was showing some signs of a turnaround.
Imposition of an anti dumping duty was expected which would enable an improvement  in the company’s financials.


I invested based on this thesis. Management seemed to be decent. I invested 15% of my portfolio. It was my first turnaround investment.


When the results were declared the turnaround wasn’t very convincing. Instead of waiting and appreciating that turnarounds take time I exited my holdings.


I had purchased at X. I exited at 1.3 X. A 30 % profit. It seemed a healthy return to me in 3-4 months.
The same company, in the next 7 quarters underwent an extraordinary turnaround. From losses to double digit profit margins. And, the stock went from X to 5X.


I couldn’t believe my eyes. I blamed my luck and derived solace that I had some profit. But, heart of hearts I knew I had made a massive error of judgement.


Lesson: Be patient. If you’re convinced about a stock after enough research stay invested for some time. Investments take time to mature, to grow.
In investments without conviction profit booking would be sensible. But, if enough conviction has been developed- Be patient, do nothing.


Sometimes inactivity is better than activity.
Here, I was a victim of fear of losing money. Hence, sold too early.
Fear and greed are major causes of bad decisions.



Lesson 4:
An important lesson I learned is on appreciation of the role of luck and the limitations of our expertise.


I have often mistaken my luck for skill. And, it has cost me a lot.
Stock trading/ investing is an incredibly complicated activity. There are so many variables involved that it’s difficult for linear thinkers like us to piece the information and take rational decisions.



To simplify the task, we resort to substituting difficult questions for easy ones.
Instead of analyzing a company based on its financials I’ll check if I like the product manufactured by that company and invest based on that.


I’ve succumbed to it often.
And, needless to say, I lost money.
Also, being rigid is harmful to us.
Despite knowing that a strategy doesn’t work, I refused to accept it. I suffered from the illusion of validity.


Acceptance is crucial for success.
Most factors are beyond our control. Frankly, there’s hardly anything in our control.


I stopped thinking of myself as a person who has everything in control and accepted the fact that I was at the mercy of variables I could do nothing about.
This change in behavior, approach helped me.
I started appreciating the contribution of luck in success.


From where we’re born, the upbringing we receive , the socioeconomic status are rarely in our control.
And,these factors play an instrumental role in moulding the future behavioral patterns of a person.


Summary of Lesson 4: The lesson I learned was that I should shed my delusion of being in control and acknowledge that despite my best efforts there will be consequences totally opposite to my expectations.



Lesson 5:
The most important lesson I learned is that I should have realistic expectations.
Stock markets aren’t get rich quick schemes.
It’s a way to participate in the growth story of a real business.


For an ordinary person like me it’s impossible to sustain 20% CAGR for long durations.
I tempered my expectations to 10-11% over the long term.


After all, what causes pain- When expectations are not met we suffer from pain, grief.
Solution is to have low expectations. If the outcome is better than our expectations our joy will be indescribable.

I humbly share the lessons I’ve learned. This forum has played an instrumental role in my growth as a person. My heartfelt thanks to each and every member here. I've realised that there's always something to learn.
Yet again, my gratitude to all.
My apologies if I’ve erred.

Monthly investment: ∅  
Maximum exposure ≤ $1,000,000

Maximum asset class exposure ≤ 25%

Management Guidelines: 

Protect capital, decide whether or not to retire.  
\-------------------------------  
\*1 Daily revenue is defined on an average 5 day work week, with 20 days off a year. All capital gains and business venture earnings count towards daily revenue.  
\*‎2 Monthly investment is 60% for Tier 1, 20% for Tier 2, and 10% for Tier 3.   
\*‎3 Crypto-currencies do count.   
\*‎4 The maximum exposure rule applies to each individual security, currency, bond, commodity, and real estate investment. It does not limit exposure by asset class. All business venture investments have no maximum exposure but capital gains cannot be used. In turn, business venture revenue cannot be reinvested other where.   
\*5 Once requirements are met for the following tier all new restrictions apply. Go back to previous tier if capital requirements are no longer met.   
\*‎6 Non-essential income is income that is not needed to pay for basic necessities like housing, food, gas, phone, music, and clothing (cheap clothes).

ATVI08-02,902ivb,Is Nintendo's slide a buy opportunity? And a look at its competitors.,1531973051.0,30,17,"TL;DR: I saw Nintendo’s slide, so I decided to take a look at them and others. I like Nintendo, but am more skeptical of the others. Thoughts on Nintendo, Activision, EA, and Take Two? If you have anything that may help me improve or understand more, please let me know.

[Data here](https://imgur.com/gallery/yOLUtyo)

I am young and getting into investing, and when I saw that Nintendo has slid over 20% in 3-months, I was surprised. I decided to look into the basic fundamentals of Nintendo and some of its competitors, if only to practice stock research. I decided to look at Nintendo ($NTDOY), Take Two ($TTWO), Electronic Arts ($EA), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Zynga ($ZNGA), Konami ($KNMCY), and Ubisoft ($UBSFY) (Nintendo, Konami, and Ubisoft are international companies, so I listed, and mainly looked at, their ADRs). I also chose to ignore Sony and Microsoft because both of these companies are very diversified beyond video games, so I thought that it might skew the data, even though Nintendo directly competes against PS4 and Xbox.

For each company, I looked at their P/E Ratio, Current Ratio, and Debt / Equity Ratio. Then I averaged each number, weighted by market cap. I found that for each of these metrics, Nintendo looks good based on P/E Ratio and Current Ratio, although its Debt/Equity is high compared to its competitors. It seems to me that Nintendo is acting more aggressively than others, but that is less concerning considering how liquid they are. The average Current ratio is 2.64, and none of the companies fall below 1, which is comforting.

These are my thoughts after looking at this information and the 3 month & 1 year returns of each company:

I am surprised at Nintendo’s performance, as they seem very healthy and I don’t see any red flags on the numbers side. News wise, I can only assume that the slide is based people seeing a relatively weak E3 and a light holiday games lineup (though, with Smash and Pokemon, I’m not sure I agree with that). I see a successful new console, and I imagine they will continue to be very successful in the coming. In addition, according to MarketWatch, this year’s estimated earnings in $2.04 vs $1.24 last year. Looks like a buy to me.

For all of the other companies, I am surprised that they have all considerably outperformed the market. It has been a good year for video games according to sources like the NPD group, but seeing high P/E ratios, especially ATVI at 180+, is scary to me. On the games side, ATVI can lean on tentpoles like Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch, but I think that there is a real possibility that the new Call of Duty could fall short. I am not bullish on ATVI. For TTWO, I fully expect Red Dead 2 to do incredibly, but its release is definitely going to be a big swing for them. 2k games seem to be shaky, but will probably still perform well. GTA5 seemly can’t stop selling, as well. I think EA is in a similar boat with its EA Sports offerings, and Battlefield V should do better than Battlefront 2 did last year. These companies all seem poised to succeed, but I don’t know how long they can continue to climb like this.

That’s all I got for this. I really enjoyed doing this research and trying to understand it. Do you agree that Nintendo is a buy? Thoughts on ATVI, EA, TTWO, and the others? Again, I’m still new at this, so I would love to hear comments and critiques, I’d love to improve. What do you think?

You\'re idea sounds more like speculation on steroids, with many unknowns to factor in (how fast will changes occur, where will they be most felt, will humanity find solutions, will uses adjust to accommodate, etc). The solutions are rewarding regardless of outcome (as in, they\'ll be used to either resolve the issue or expand the possibilities).

Anyway, not a great way to win on increasing grain prices.  \n  \nIf your thesis were sound, then it also would be very non uniform.  Higher costs and lower crop yields would be distributed very unevenly, while higher grain prices would be distributed more evenly.  So if you actually had some insight into climate change, you could win big on grain prices, by buying into the agricultural businesses that won\'t be hit with higher cost and lower yield.  That obviously won\'t work for you because ""studying"" just mean believing doom scenarios spewed by idiots and liars.

ICE08-02,8vkogd,[DD] Disney is a buy at its current valuation,1530553802.0,37,23,"Disney is a great company with shareholder-oriented management. It has great economics with above average returns on capital employed and returns on equity. The stability of these metrics over the years signifies their entrenched competitive advantage (which we all already knew). Their debt is also very manageable with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.43 this past quarter.

In addition, Disney is still continuing their [share buyback program of $6bn in 2018](https://marketrealist.com/2017/11/disney-aims-6-billion-share-repurchase-fy18) which seems like icing on the cake for shareholders given its current valuation in comparison with the market.

There is also growth potential with their streaming service coming down the pipeline, their brand growth in China as signified by the [explosive attendance numbers at their new Shanghai Disneyland](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-26/china-s-craving-for-entertainment-drives-shanghai-disney-growth) and [the overall growing Chinese box office](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/china-box-office-overtakes-north-america-first-quarter-2018-n862371).

If I had to guess on why it has been moving sideways, it would be because of fear on this deal not passing or other potential anti-trust regulations. [But the speed at which this deal has been going forward with gives it favorable odds that it will pass through.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/01/opinion/disney-fox-deal.html) In addition, [the passing of the AT&T-Time Warner deal is also a major sign that the courts will also be lax with consolidation in the media industry](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-ruling-antitrust-case.html) as well.

Looking at their average EBIT/EV of 8.1% over the past year, along with the factors mentioned above, there's a sufficient margin of safety over any conservative risk-free rate you might choose (whether the deal passes through or not). And if the deal does not pass, it will be an even better buying opportunity from the inevitable overreaction.

TTWO08-02,902ivb,Is Nintendo's slide a buy opportunity? And a look at its competitors.,1531973051.0,30,16,"TL;DR: I saw Nintendo’s slide, so I decided to take a look at them and others. I like Nintendo, but am more skeptical of the others. Thoughts on Nintendo, Activision, EA, and Take Two? If you have anything that may help me improve or understand more, please let me know.

[Data here](https://imgur.com/gallery/yOLUtyo)

I am young and getting into investing, and when I saw that Nintendo has slid over 20% in 3-months, I was surprised. I decided to look into the basic fundamentals of Nintendo and some of its competitors, if only to practice stock research. I decided to look at Nintendo ($NTDOY), Take Two ($TTWO), Electronic Arts ($EA), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Zynga ($ZNGA), Konami ($KNMCY), and Ubisoft ($UBSFY) (Nintendo, Konami, and Ubisoft are international companies, so I listed, and mainly looked at, their ADRs). I also chose to ignore Sony and Microsoft because both of these companies are very diversified beyond video games, so I thought that it might skew the data, even though Nintendo directly competes against PS4 and Xbox.

For each company, I looked at their P/E Ratio, Current Ratio, and Debt / Equity Ratio. Then I averaged each number, weighted by market cap. I found that for each of these metrics, Nintendo looks good based on P/E Ratio and Current Ratio, although its Debt/Equity is high compared to its competitors. It seems to me that Nintendo is acting more aggressively than others, but that is less concerning considering how liquid they are. The average Current ratio is 2.64, and none of the companies fall below 1, which is comforting.

These are my thoughts after looking at this information and the 3 month & 1 year returns of each company:

I am surprised at Nintendo’s performance, as they seem very healthy and I don’t see any red flags on the numbers side. News wise, I can only assume that the slide is based people seeing a relatively weak E3 and a light holiday games lineup (though, with Smash and Pokemon, I’m not sure I agree with that). I see a successful new console, and I imagine they will continue to be very successful in the coming. In addition, according to MarketWatch, this year’s estimated earnings in $2.04 vs $1.24 last year. Looks like a buy to me.

For all of the other companies, I am surprised that they have all considerably outperformed the market. It has been a good year for video games according to sources like the NPD group, but seeing high P/E ratios, especially ATVI at 180+, is scary to me. On the games side, ATVI can lean on tentpoles like Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch, but I think that there is a real possibility that the new Call of Duty could fall short. I am not bullish on ATVI. For TTWO, I fully expect Red Dead 2 to do incredibly, but its release is definitely going to be a big swing for them. 2k games seem to be shaky, but will probably still perform well. GTA5 seemly can’t stop selling, as well. I think EA is in a similar boat with its EA Sports offerings, and Battlefield V should do better than Battlefront 2 did last year. These companies all seem poised to succeed, but I don’t know how long they can continue to climb like this.

That’s all I got for this. I really enjoyed doing this research and trying to understand it. Do you agree that Nintendo is a buy? Thoughts on ATVI, EA, TTWO, and the others? Again, I’m still new at this, so I would love to hear comments and critiques, I’d love to improve. What do you think?

There are so many laws and legal hoops and regulatory shit that they aren't currently doing.  I'm not saying Amazon couldn't, I just don't think they'll be able to very quickly, nor do they have the retail space entrenched that CVS has.

Amazon might be able to do that in some urban areas but nowhere near as many places as CVS or retail places. "", 'There was a post about Walgreens a while back where I went into a discussion about generics and how generics for something like Claritin can now be found at Amazon, Target, Walmart for a fraction of what it costs at Walgreens and CVS. The numbers are rather startling (I mean, you can get Walgreens ""Wal-itin"" for $29.99 for 90 or.... you can buy 300 generic Claritin on Amazon for $13) and I think it kinda plays into my view that CVS and Walgreens prices are really kind of ridiculous for a lot of things. Both chains played into convenience for a very long time - ""the quick trip"" because Walgreens or CVS is close and maybe you needed to go to the pharmacy. \n\nNow you have Amazon Now (1-2 hours), Target Restock, Kroger Ship and the eventuality of Pill Pack from Amazon. As for clinics, more and more people are going to be using things like Teladoc (although I guess CVS is working in some regard with Teladoc), but the whole thing to me in the broadest view is the idea that there is going to be gradually less and less reason to go into a CVS or Walgreens in the years ahead.\n\nI don\'t see CVS or Walgreens going away by any means, but I think there has to be some discussion as to what is the role of the store in the future as more and more services replace the Walgreens/CVS ""quick trip"". Additionally, neither Walgreens or CVS stores are a great experience in many cases; the companies aren\'t doing much to make the stores a compelling place to go to if you don\'t have to.\n\nAmazon and the threat of Amazon is certainly a large factor, but I think there\'s something broader than just Amazon behind the decline in CVS/Walgreens.\n\n']"

So the basic outline is Elon has the funding needed secured but he would prefer to diversify ownership to prevent any one or two players from having a de facto controlling stake.

Multiple exchange personnel, former SEC staff and investigators have literally commented on it laying out what needs to be shown here and as of yet it hasn't been.\n\nRealistically even if he wants to diversify and fund this is a terrible way to do it too.  You want other parties that might be interested to know you have people to make this go through.

Deleted, and let\'s try this again (sorry, the website on my phone just wasn\'t detailed enough).\n\nExchange trading is typically a limit order book. You place an order, with a set price. It can sit there indefinitely, and eventually (hopefully) someone will come along and execute against you. There are buyers and sellers represented at nearly all times. The same is true if you want to buy or sell immediately. You see orders for the opposite side (sellers if you are buying, buyers if you are selling) and you know immediately how much they are willing to offer for your shares and how many shares they are willing to buy/sell.\n\nOTC trading is a bit different, and typically is used either for large orders or for instruments that don\'t have enough interest to form a natural two-sided market (like you would have on an exchange). In these systems you place what is, effectively, a request for a quote. ""I\'m interested in shares in Frank\'s Hotdog Palace. How much do you want to sell them for?"" The person on the other side of the counter (your broker, or in the case of some systems one of many brokers on a shared platform) quotes you a price. At this point you can decide if you want to do the trade.\n\nThis differs from limit order books where once you have displayed your interest either you will trade, or you will not trade. There is no opportunity to second guess for either party. The price is known at the time the order is placed.']"

LB08-22,94ndy6,Life Changing Profits...the case for Uranium and UUUU,1533424881.0,73,3,"In 2006 there was a bitcoin like rally in uranium and uranium stocks. UUUU went from $10 to $200 in one year. In 2011 there was another run taking UUUU from $6 to $66. I believe we are at such an inflection point again with some important differences that may well make this run dwarf those previous two.

Uranium has gone through a prolonged bear market. It is not untrue in the commodity space to claim that the cure for low prices is low prices and no where might this be more true than in uranium. Over this decade long bear market the number of producers or wanna be producers has shrunk from 900 to less than 40. There has been massive supply destruction to the point were actual deficits are on the horizon. Despite Fukushima there are more than 300 new reactors in some form of construction or planning, more than there were prior to Fukushima all the while supply of uranium has been in rapid decline. This is a simple arithmetic problem...no supply, increasing demand equals higher prices. Because of the nature of the uranium market there are no substitutes and real buying panics can ensue as utilities rush to the window to secure long term supplies. I think this is very likely to happen as it did twice since 2006 but given the lack of existing miners to meet this demand the price spike may well dwarf those previous two.

Add to this another entirely new dynamic.....The US has allowed itself to nearly lose its domestic supply of fuel to unfriendly foreign entities. We now have a national security issue where 20% of US electricity production is at risk of disruption. This is not going to stand. A section 232 has been filed on behalf of the few remaining US producers of uranium and I'm nearly 100% certain a remedy will be had giving US producers a quota of 25% of the domestic demand. How big this is cannot be overstated. With only a couple of existing US miners this means a $30 premium over global contract pricing and guaranteed business at many fold production increases. Enter UUUU

UUUU is what I would call a best of breed company. It is the largest, best capitalized, most experienced US based miner with capacity to produce 12 million lbs per year. They also are the only current producer of Vanadium in N. America...a mineral at an all time high price mind you. UUUU has the potential if all the stars align to regain those lofty stock prices in the near term...2-3 years and potentially exceed them. This truly is a life changing possibility that can add zeros to your net worth. 

UUUU is the only stock I would consider...it is best of breed and 1st in line to benefit from a section 232 passage and a renewed bull market in the commodity. I am definitely talking my book here as I have an extensive position in the company but I must add that it is because of my total conviction that something extraordinary is unfolding.

People are already placing bets on it judging by the recent stock performance. But the way I see it, utilities are going to oppose any action that raises the price of uranium. Why should we bet that utility lobbyists will fail to stop the measures you are predicting?\n\nHere\'s a [balanced article](https://www.macombdaily.com/business/trump-officials-weigh-limits-on-uranium-invoking-national-security/article_926a42a1-322e-5778-b273-3b2621df5375.html) that includes some points for, and against, your thesis.\n\n> The Nuclear Energy Institute also said it was opposed to any moves to limit imports. ""We sympathize with the plight of uranium suppliers,"" NEI president Maria Korsnick said in a statement. ""However, NEI does not support the implementation of quotas as described in the petition. Potential remedies could put even more generating units at risk for premature closure, which would further soften the market for uranium.""\n\nand also\n\n> Independent nuclear experts said that the U.S. military can rely on large stockpiles.

CRM08-29,97nhns,How does Salesforce make such little money?,1534378455.0,34,18,"This is a serious question. SFDC reported 8.4B of revenue in 2017.

For comparison, AWS, who only does 10% of Amazon's revenue and has like 35% marketshare of a more competitive space, made 17B in the same period. 

In the same vein of thought, if SFDC has higher market penetration, lower growth, half the revenue, and a market cap of 100B+, is it safe to say AWS likely contributes to 200B+ of Amazon's market cap?

Is CRM affordable compared to other SaaS? Would appreciate enlightenment in this area. ",0.76,"['Salesforce sell Software-as-a-service (""SaaS""). Over the past few years, there\'s been a huge drive to shift software companies to sell their package under an ongoing subscription model, as opposed to under a perpetual license. The shift causes an understandable decline in revenue, but over the long-term delivers a sustainable, recurring revenue stream, as well as increased profitability. Subscription-based business models deliver considerably improved valuation multiples, principally because of the greater growth potential (each new sale is years worth of income, thus providing a base each year, and any new sale is inherently year-on-year growth, less your attrition/churn rate) and markedly improved profitability. Recurrent revenue streams deliver gross margin north of 50%, whereas perpetual license is in the low teens. It\'s earnings that\'s the comparable metric, when your benchmarking a subscription-based business against perpetual license.\n\nEssentially, ignore revenue, as it\'s irrelevant unless doing a comparison between two subscription-based businesses. In addition, one of those two businesses could simply have a more mature subscription-based strategy, whilst the other is only recently migrating from perpetual license to subscription.\n\nSource: I\'m a PE analyst that works on TMT transactions.

ADBE09-13,973h3b,Getting solidly beat by S&P500 this year - lessons learned?,1534204314.0,26,17,"Most people crow about  gainz, but I'm getting beat pretty solidly by the S&P500 so far this year, despite a pretty straightforward portfolio, so I thought I'd share a few thoughts on why I'm +1.5% vs. SPY +6.6%.... 5% off pace.

* My top holding (15% of portfolio), CAPE (uses CAPE ratio for focus on sectors) is actually outperforming (+8.9%) as it often does
* Next, VTI (10%) is on par, as expected, and even a little ahead (+8.2%)
* Other beta=1 holdings are SPY (6%), SUSA (environmentally friendly SPY, 5% of portfolio) is +5.4%

I also have a few variants to tweak my weightings away from tech mega cap, but typically return the same:

* SCHA is +8.6%, EQL is even sector weighting, +4.5% combined for \~10% of portfolio.
* IUSV is value small cap, which has been weak, (+1%) but is only 2% of my portfolio.

So far so good!

Then, I get nailed with my ex-US ETFs:

* Europe/Developed: VEA (7% of portfolio) down (-4%), SCZ & EFV (small cap/value developed ETFs @ 3% of portfolio) down  4%
* Emerging: VWO (2%) is down almost 9% and EEM (same weighting) is down about the same.

Then there's a few bond funds:

* IBDQ, IBMG and HYG, combined at about 10% of portfolio, are flat

And REIT ETFs:

* VNQ is flat, VNQI down 5% for about 10% of my portfolio.

With individual stocks, I'm mostly doing great, but it's <10% of my portfolio:

* AAPL, BRK.B, ADBE, GOOG, LLY

(And then I'm down a bunch from GBTC giving back gains from the past couple of years, but still far in the black after selling in increments over the years.)

Overall? I'm mainly weak because of ex-US and the other parts of my portfolio used for diversification. Indeed, my performance is pretty darn close to VT over this year. So, I'm following a lot of the received wisdom on diversification of all sorts, and performing as expected.

DRI09-20,9bwtnx,We’re shorting Square Inc (SQ) and this is why you should too,1535745142.0,106,67,"**Description**

Square (SQ) is a payment processor which caters to small businesses. At $88.00 we think SQ has 65% downside to fair value of $36.00.  The basic premise of the short thesis is:

 

FDC is the industry giant with close to 40% market share, over the past 18 months they have put a ton of resources behind their Clover product which is aimed directly at SQ, it is currently growing 50% and is on pace to be a larger business than SQ by 2020.  Additionally, they have finally gotten their act together with digital customer onboarding (SQ’s primary early competitive edge) and will launch the capabilities through their massive distribution channel starting in the 2H 2018.  Odds are slim that this will not impact SQ competitively and slow their growth rate.

SQ’s core payment processing business growth has in fact already slowed and accelerating top line growth is being driven by more cyclical and risky businesses such as short term working capital loans (Instant Deposit) and lending origination (Square Capital).  

As a point of reference, Square does not control underwriting for their Square Capital product, if banks decided to stop lending to their micro merchants and originations dried up it would take EBIT down by about 35%.

SQ’s customers are by far the most exposed to any kind of economic downturn, close to 60% do less than $125k in volume every year and close to 85% do less than $500k.

Given the above points SQ’s valuation is absurd.  It trades at close to 20x sales and 68x EBITDA.  This is even more disgusting given that of the $245M of EBITDA the street is expecting this year about $215M will be stock comp which everyone is happy to back out (the share count was 360m in 2016 and it will end this year at 480m).

Our fair value target is 30x our 2020 eps estimate of $1.20.  Our estimates assume continued strong growth in both processing and services with steady economic growth, should a recession occur there would be significant downside to our estimates/target.

 **First Data**

 As mentioned above, FDC is the 800lb gorilla in the industry.  We think SQ has been a benefactor of the issues FDC has been having in their bank JV channel for the past 18 months or so stemming mostly from WFC’s branch commission scandal.  The JV channel was always a crown jewel for FDC because anyone who walked into a major bank to apply for a small business loan would have the processing relationship jammed in their face upon closing the deal.  Starting in Q4 of 2017 the leads generated from this channel flattened out after declining by roughly 20% and it feels like the bottom has been reached, as the banks start generating more leads its reasonable to assume some portion would be at SQ’s expense.

SQ’s early competitive edge was digital onboarding.  It takes 10 minutes and can be done without assistance.  Expenses are lower and the customer doesn’t have to deal with greasy salespeople.  Until now FDC had been way behind the curve but starting in the 2H of this year they will roll it out across all channels.  This is particularly important in the JV channel given their bank partners have a combined 6m small business accounts.

At current run rate SQ will do about $80B in GPV for 2018 its growth rate will be around 30%.  Over the same time period FDC’s Clover will do $60B in GPV and growth 50% or so.  Clover is a direct competitor to SQ and industry chatter on the platform is increasingly positive.  We think that if nothing else this shows that SQ does not have a “moat” and the payments processing industry is mature and quite competitive.  SQ’s valuation suggests it’s business model is unique and difficult to replicate, Clover’s success and growth indicates the opposite.

 

**Square Capital and Instant Deposit**

 Another reason SQ gets such a fancy multiple is because investors are excited about the accelerating revenue growth rate driven by the “Subscription and Services-Based” segment.  This accounts for 33% of the total business and grew 98% y/y in Q1.  About 65% of this segment is Square Capital and Instant Deposit and the remaining 35% other odds and ends with the largest chunk being their restaurant delivery service Caviar.  While the growth is both real and impressive we don’t think investors are baking in the cyclical risks of the lending businesses. 

The risks to Square Capital are pretty obvious.  Banks originate the loans and SQ takes 8-15% off the top.  No originations = no revenue and its basically pure profit.  We believe this will be $70m in revs/EBIT this year.

Instant Deposit has been the major growth engine for the past 12 months.  In 2016 it didn’t exist and this year it will likely be a $180M business.  Merchants get charged a 1% for instant settlement of funds versus the standard T+3.  

First of all this is very expensive, PYPL does it for a $0.25 flat fee and larger banks do it for free.  So why does SQ get this?  Our guess would be that nobody else wants to extend credit to these merchants.  

SQ claims the risk is minimal because payments are taken directly out of the merchant’s gross receipts, however, there is nothing to stop them from abandoning their terminal if business gets tough.  The company has always said a lot of their customers didn’t take cards before signing up, so there isn’t a lot stopping them from going back to cash.  This will be about $190m of revs this year with high contribution margins.

 

**Valuation**

 
On a day to day basis SQ seems to want to trade with the FANG complex and it wears a valuation to match that characterization trading at close to 20x sales.  Our issue is that there is nothing recurring about the business model, attrition is close to 20% annually, and their customers will be the first to fold in a downturn.  We think its true comps are FDC/WP/GPN which trade at between 12-19x forward earnings.  SQ deserves a premium due to its growth rate so we think 30x 2020 eps is reasonable.

 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

DRI09-20,9f91gh,Construction companies to invest in because of hurricane?,1536768106.0,10,0,"With hurricane Florence coming there will be a lot of destruction meaning that a lot of stuff will have to be rebuilt. Below are some businesses that may benefit from  it:

&#x200B;

**Outdoor products manufacturer** – When the wind and rain of a hurricane come howling down, flagpoles, picnic furniture, potted plants and everything else stored outside tend to take the brunt of the beating. For those residents without major structural damage, getting these things replaced will be first on the ""to-do"" list.

**Roofing, building and construction materials suppliers** – Packing winds of up to 150 mph, [hurricanes take no prisoners when they hit land.](http://www.livescience.com/11260-hurricanes-nature-biggest-storms.html) Homes, businesses, schools, churches and every other type of structure will likely be damaged.  Whether it's replacing siding or shingles, installing a window, putting up a new garage door, or needing to rebuild altogether, building and construction materials are always in the highest demand after a hurricane hits.

**Tree limb removal** – Trees have little chance of standing fully intact after taking the impact of hurricane force winds and rain.  Tree removal services are often one of the first businesses called to the scene to remove broken and dangling limbs from power lines and blocked streets.  Once taking care of those major responsibilities, they then must shift their attention to all of residential yards littered with broken branches.  A hurricane will keep tree limb removal businesses busy for weeks, if not months.

**Water damage restoration** – In addition to the damaging winds, hurricanes also smack the area with pounding rain.  With increased rain always comes the potential for flooding problems.  Water damage restoration specialists are called in after a major storm to help properly dry out a business or home to ensure the problem areas don't spread even further, and that mold has no opportunity to start growing.

**Hotels** – When hurricanes threaten to come ashore, those potentially affected coastal areas are often quickly evacuated.  Without anywhere else to turn, many of those residents are forced to drive inland and stay in a hotel until given the okay to return home. Driving inland from the potentially affected area, the site of no vacancy signs is a common site following a hurricane.

**Grocery stores** – Before a hurricane ever even hits, residents from every area that could potentially be affected flock to their local grocery store to stock up on the necessities.  Once the storm blows in, the potential to be trapped inside for a few days without access to the grocery store or restaurants is a very real possibility. That leaves those in the storms path scrambling for everything from water and juice, to eggs and bread.

**Gas stations** – When communities are evacuated because of a hurricane, it sends thousands of people into their cars and trucks and onto the road.  Not knowing how far they may need to drive for to avoid the storm's path, drivers are forced to fill up for the long drive. Gas stations directly in the storm's path will see lines of vehicles snaking out their station for miles down the road waiting to refuel prior to a major storm bearing down.

**Insurance** – At first glance, it might seem as if insurance companies would take a big hit following a storm. While that might be the case in those communities directly affected, in other areas of the county, the storms often spur on business.  Hurricanes and [other natural disasters](http://www.livescience.com/11327-natural-disasters-top-10-threats.html) give everyone, not just those directly impacted, an opportunity to re-evaluate their own insurance needs.  Many times, major storms give that extra kick to a home or business owner who was thinking about adding some additional insurance, but wasn't positive the timing was right.  After seeing how devastating a hurricane can be, no one wants to be left without enough insurance to cover their loses.

**Auto body repair** – With hurricanes comes hail.  As the ice pellets rocket down to the ground, its cars and trucks that will suffer the most damage. Vehicles will be covered with dents, leaving auto body repair professionals to help get those cars looking new again.  

**Waste management services** – When all is said and done, it will be the responsibility of local waste management companies to haul off all of the trash and debris caused by the devastating storms. While it might not be glamorous, removing all of the trash that builds up during the cleanup process is critical to restoring life back to normal in the affected cities and towns

What companies within these industries do you think will benefit?

 Hurricane Florence could wreak more than $170bn of havoc, according to analytics firm CoreLogic. 

&#x200B;",0.5,"[""/r/investing when a hurricane is literally making landfall:\n\n> Do Y'all think anyone on Wallstreet knows this is happening yet or is now the best time to get ahead of it?"", ""I really don't have any direct knowledge of how hurricanes impact profitability but I'll give you my opinions based on living in Florida my entire life and experiencing many hurricanes. \n\nFirst, a certain $ amount in damages does not mean that same $ will flow into reconstruction. In my experience, a lot of damage is just cleaned up or temporarily repaired. Permanent repair and replacement are significantly delayed by lack of labor and materials (not enough people to do the work, no one will return your calls for a quote, and wait lists are a year or more). So repair expenses end up being delayed and trickle into businesses over many months or years. \n\nSecond, many companies that do get paid relatively quickly (roofing contractors, waste management, tree removal) may not actually experience increased profitability.

FAST10-10,9gevrn,Why has the fast food industry avoided automated food preparation by robots?,1537137410.0,49,33,"I've read that single fast food locations, here and there, have been using robots to prepare food ([a recent example](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-burger-joint-where-robots-make-your-food-1529599213)). However, it's puzzling to me how this has not reached scale decades ago already. 

For an initial high quality robot, the set up costs might be relatively high (design, materials etc.), but if you consider how much money is spent on human food preparers, the breakeven point should be reached relatively soon - even considering the ironing out of initial defects and quality considerations. The large chains, especially, should be incentivized to do so, given their economies of scale.  

I'm trying to play devil's advocate, but I can't come up with any reason why most of the fast food preparation today isn't automated. Maybe you need high skill labor to fix the machines, but a large chain could iron out the most common issues very quickly and then have a regional repairperson on call when ""rare events"" occur.",0.78,"['Because the cost to acquire and maintain that type of technology is likely far more expensive than minimum wage employees.\n\nWhat is the labor skill cost to flip a burger VS keeping someone who knows IT to program the robot if it errors?\n\nThis does not include the costs of remodeling. Nor lost sales when it faulters. There are also liability issues to consider.', ""Here's my $0.05 from industrial automation perspective. Broadly speaking, you need to consider 1) volume (of products) 2) task isolation and 3) environment control:\n\n**Volume**\n\nOn average a McDonalds store serves around 200-250 customers a day. That is too low for an automation system. You really need thousands of pieces produced per day. It only makes sense for partial preparation of the food for 100s of stores, which is what McDonalds does (as do other chains) - the meat and the buns are churned out by the thousands from a central plant and shipped to the stores for final processing.\n\n**Task Isolation**\n\nYou want to break a production process into really small tasks and automate each separately. Like one part portions the raw material, another one shapes it, then another feeds it, then you get a chain of robots where each does a small task (charr it, flip it, cool it etc.) and then you get a part that retrieves the finished piece and another set of robots that package it.\n\nThis keeps the cost of creating such an automation system down and makes it easy to maintain. It also makes the system really large. Again, this is a limitation for putting an automation system in each store. They're not big enough.\n\n**Environment Control**\n\nYou want to keep the environment steady - same temperature, humidity, low vibration etc. Also free of polutants/particles that interfere with the operation. This is generally a problem for food production, where your product needs to be heated, dipped in hot oil, frozen etc. In a food processing facility you solve this by making your machines bigger (more isolation in their walls) and the distances between the parts of your system larger (i.e. so that your hot oil does not spray onto your next robot).\n\nOn the other hand your typical food chain kitchen is too messy for robots - they would always have to work outside of specified parameters, get polluted and break down more often, unless you invest a lot of capital to make them extreme environment proof.\n\nThose are, in broad strokes, the reasons why there is food automation only to some extent."", 'The people are cheaper versions of robots.', 'Before you ever see robots in fast food you will see automated ordering and the end of cashiers.  ', 'Because a human earning $7 an hour costs less than a multimillion dollar robot. ', 'It’s expensive as fuck.

Soon we will see automated fast food places with 90 percent robots running the place"", ""You're still looking at 60k per station, with accompanying debugging. When you're looking at $15/hr per station that may just be viable."", ""It might be that the cost savings just isn't there. Labor really doesn't amount for much of cost on a per unit basis."", ""I'll probably get downvoted for this, but putting aside the financial aspect, I don't think it would currently be great for McDs image to suddenly become a giant vending machine.

What will all the fast food workers do without a job? What will the 5 million retail workers do when those stores copy the fast food industry? The rich people don't want an army to form."", 'Theres also an ethical dilemma to it.

**1. Spend less than your cash flow.** Easy enough concept, and it is the number one rule.

**2. Pay yourself first.** When you get your paycheck, set money aside for yourself before any person or company you owe. This will determine whether you move up financially or not.

**3. Every dollar is an investment.** Even if you are going to Disneyland, it is an investment into your personal happiness and an investment into the relationships you are building with your companions. Every dollar you spend must be advancing you in some way. This will fight off instant gratification.

**4. Always expand your knowledge on making financial choices.** You have never learned everything you need to know. I don't care what school you went to. Keep reading, keep learning.

**5. Don't listen to false prophets.** Just as I encourage you to learn more, it is important to tune out of the advice of people who set bad examples. If your dad is 65 years old and still has not retired, you might want to think twice about following his instructions. Instead, listen to high-identity people.

**6. Set yourself up for financial security, don't have your job do it for you.** This is so important, and yet absolutely no one follows this rule. If you get a job, your employer will sit you down with HR, and an unqualified person from HR will give you deferred compensation options. This person is not licensed in financial options, and so cannot legally advise you. Choose your own retirement vehicles, because it is very likely you can hop employers.

**7. Shop for competing prices for everything and never buy anything at full price!** Clothes, car maintenance, insurance. If you are ever paying full price for a service, you are being exploited.

**8. Take care of yourself physically and legally.** Smoking will raise your life and health premiums. Getting a DUI will disqualify you from life insurance all together. This closes doors that can save you from being a slave till the end of your days.

**9.** **Your hourly earnings are important.** Your annual earnings are not. *Someone making $50,000 a year at $500 an hour has more of their time (meaning their life) than someone making $100,000 at $50 an hour.* This is the single most important concept in understanding who is rich and who is not. *Someone is not living an enriched life because they have amassed wealth and material possessions.* ***Someone is living an enriched life because they have the freedom to spend their time how they wish!***",0.92,"['ill take 2 500$ an hour jobs please', '(18M) Glad I came across this today.

You don't ever want to have to deal with debt, be that credit cards, or loans, or anything like that.

Someone is living an enriched life because they have the freedom to spend their time how they wish!\n\nI understand the sentiment here, but I can't agree. Sure, time is valuable, but sometimes you have to consider what the appropriate compromise is for the best long-term outcome. High hourly earnings mean nothing if your annual earnings are too low to take you where you want to be in 10 years time for example. The wealth you can accumulate by working harder and earning $100k a year in your 20's compared to coasting on $50k can dramatically change the rest of your life.

IBM10-16,9kyw9x,An index-plus strategy where you buy the S&P and then buy the top performers in it would not have significantly improved your performance and in fact would have hurt it in the last 30 years.,1538550443.0,61,104,"I see a common strategy that many tend to employ is to pick an index like the s&p and then pick some of the stocks in the top 10 of the index that they think are good companies. The idea behind this is to get a boost by increasing the concentration of the ""winners"". (I am guilty of this as well)

For example buying the VFINX and then buying Apple, Visa and Microsoft because those are great companies and being slightly overweight on these great companies should translate to an above average return.

I was curious whether history would agree with this approach. So, I went back ~30 years (a good time horizon when saving for retirement) to the year 1988 and found these were the top 10 companies by market cap in the s&p:
IBM
EXXON
GENERAL ELECTRIC
AT&T
ROYAL DUTCH PETROL
GENERAL MOTORS
FORD
PHILIP MORRIS
MERCK
DUPONT

I constructed 3 portfolios.

Portfolio 1: S&P 500 index only

Portfolio 2: S&P 500 + the top 5 companies in the index 50/50

Portfolio 2 had a CAGR of 10.42%
Portfolio3  had a CAGR of 9.42%

You actually underperformed by using the ""index plus"" strategy and if you just picked the hot stocks of that year you would have lost more than 1% in annual return. 

Picking winners is very hard. IBM at the time was cutting-edge tech. If you had bought it and held until now, it would have given you a CAGR of 7.82% grossly underperforming the index. GE, which probably seemed unstoppable at the time, would have done even worse at 6.74%. You would have done just as well (and better compared to GE) if you had just bought Long Term Treasuries that would have returned 7.64% CAGR.

This was a simple exercise and I'm sure you can find a myriad of exceptions but I think it illustrates the point that you most likely won't beat the market average in the long run.

Now some of you might say that picking less well known stocks not in the index might have helped in outperforming the index. 

Maybe, but most amateur investors just buy what is well known (look at what is mentioned on this and other subs). If they ventured off this path and tried to buy obscure companies they likely would do much worse because valuation is very hard.

Indexing isn't sexy. It's lazy. But it works.

NFLX10-16,9nnz4x,Netflix -NFLX,1539377433.0,45,6,"When I look at Netflix I see a company burning money on Netflix originals with limited success.
Netflix lost its core model that I think kept many users around, it was place to watch shows you missed on TV or catch up. Netflix has moved aggressively towards Netflix originals which I just do not feel will work out with them in the long run.

I see a company that of course has a stable user base and is making strides internationally, but has been top dog in a specific market with lower levels of competition. 

I think that when AT&T, Disney and Walmart release their streaming networks Netflix will see real competition and content will become more expensive with more bidders.

Not to mention the pure amount of content a company like Disney and even AT&T (Time Warner Cable) has to offer. Will people look for other options besides Netflix or is Netflix something people will always have a subscription too. That is a question up for debate, but in my opinion it has to hurt.

With that said, I think Netflix is right up there with Disney and HBO in terms of quality and quantity.  Netflix also has a huge international market now which doesn't hurt.  I do think ultimately Disney comes out a head once their service is up.  If you look at box office for movies all anyone cares about is Marvel and Star Wars these days.  Disney owns all of those back catalogs and will keep making more including new exclusive original content for streaming like the new live action Star Wars series.  Disney can also package more into a subscription like park and Disney store discounts for example in a similar way that Amazon does with Prime.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've had a Netflix subscription since the days before streaming existed and I hardly use it anymore.  I feel like their original content is overly saturated right now.

My 10 year old can navigate it and stay in his lane, as opposed to when I let him watch Sesame Street on HBO and came back later to find him watching soft core porn.\n\nWe have Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Now that we pay specifically for, and we get Hulu and Showtime bundled with our student Spotify account.  We'll move in and out of the HBO subscription depending on what we want to binge, and I imagine it will be the same with the other services when they come out.  We'll have them for a limited time and then cancel and watch something else for a while.  However, we'll always have Netflix for the kids and 90% of the time if something is streaming in our house it's a Netflix show.\n\nAt some point, I think there will be a move by Netflix competitors to keep you from cancelling their subscription, whether it be a cheaper yearly option or by limiting how many weeks of back episodes you can watch.

If you check out the ""Business Wars"" podcast on Netflix vs Blockbuster this will impress you. Unknown to most, Blockbuster did try and pivot and compete with Netflix on streaming. They even slammed their prices and had the temporary competitive advantage of supplementation with brick and mortar stores. Despite those advantages -- and literally copying the website design of Netflix \\*exactly\\* -- they still couldn\'t compete because their tech couldn\'t hold water compared to Netflix. I think the tech barrier is the most important thing to watch with Netflix valuation versus competition going forward. Disney\'s (and the others) success will depend on it IMO. ', ""I see Netflix dominating streaming in the short and long term. Their original content is pretty damn good. One of their biggest strengths is that they don't have ads and everything is free. Amazon is not like that and neither is Hulu, two of it's biggest competitors. Another one is the selection of movies, e.g. Jurassic Park, Dark Knight, etc. It's light years ahead of any other streaming service in content and ease of use. \n\nIt is spending like crazy and it needs users to grow its revenue.

JNJ10-16,9hgvja,Argument For Buying/Holding JNJ. Especially if you are nervous about overall market.,1537462145.0,7,0,"If you bought JNJ last month, you got it under $130.

JNJ is extremely diversified, global, has a wide moat, and extremely strong patent portfolio.

One of very few AAA rated companies left, very strong balance sheet, very strong drug pipeline.

People are always going to want to live, and will pay anything for it. This is the company is in the 'keeping people alive' industry through pharma, medical device, consumer healthcare products, biotech.

The US/global population is getting older. Their cash flow is getting stronger, and there is a push from large shareholders to increase the dividend. JNJ has been very vocal about how 'tax reform' (aka tax cuts to the wealthiest) is going to boost their profitability.

Some other factors:

1. All lawsuits are controlled. All talc suits get throw out in appeals. Knee replacements will cost them $10BB and it is already factored in. That is it.
2. Worried about a global health epidemic? Hold pharma stocks.
3. There is not going to be any change to healthcare over the next 20 years considering how difficult and politically costly the ACA was.
4. Tech can't disrupt the space like almost everything else due to regulation/FDA.

JNJ combines growth and yield.

I did an internship at JNJ and I can tell you that company is guided by a value proposition credo, and the leadership/culture is extremely solid. Read up on senior management of the organisation. The culture reminds me that of Google, or a progressive, forward thinking organization that doesn't put short term profits ahead of long term objectives.

P/E is 14. Not the best, but in this market i will take it from JNJ any day of the week. Im holding 515 shares, with dividend reinvestment with the objective of holding for the next 25 years. 

Yea sure you can buy VHCIX, or a small cap pharma managed fund, but I am confident JNJ will be the best-in-class for the industry over the next 25 years. No gimmicks and less risk.

ALSO, final note is if you are worried about the market, JNJ isn't recession proof, no stock is, but their valuation is always reasonable, and they always bounce back quickly.",0.5,"['How does someone that is probably still in college since you just did an internship there afford 515 shares of JNJ?', ""Your last statement holds the key IMO.

JNJ10-16,9odyqd,You have a million dollars to invest today and you can't touch this money for at least 10 years. What 5+ individual stocks do you buy?,1539619254.0,103,40,"No index funds because that's easy. 

Why can't you touch this money? It's because you have a crazy uncle who wants to play a game with you, Brewster's millions style but instead of spending money, it's money you save with a limitation of holding it 10 years in his custody. After those 10 years are up, you get the full amount in the account in cash not shares. 

I'm sure most of you will say BRK so you must have at least 5 stocks and at most 10. To further force you to take some risk and prevent something like 99% BRK weighing, they will all have even weighting so 20% each if you pick 5 stocks. Dividends if any will be automatically reinvested into the payer, no re-balancing, no touching of the account after your initial purchase no matter what happens.  

What companies' management, clout, product, etc do you trust enough to lock up money for 10 years? If you can expand on why for each company that'd be great too.

This fall has also pushed a number of my positions that were up a lot into flat or even net losses, and I've been wanting to rotate some out of tech as I'm way over weight there.

Do I sell some of those tech positions now that they are at a loss and move them to some of the more stable positions I was hoping to get into?

Do I keep the cash sitting - obviously no one can predict the bottom etc etc etc, so do I just bite and enter on this dip with half of the cash on the sidelines?

-DIS

-TRBCX

-JNJ

-V

-MSFT (yeah tech but, solid co)



- DO i add more to the tech stocks I had, I mean a lot fo the gains were wiped out: ADBE, ROKU,  AMZN, GOOG, FB (FANG looking attractive), and what do i do with SQuare [ave in 76 - buy more?]?

-suggestions? Also what do you guys think about Macy's? I dind't realize they are giving a 4.7% dividend [It wasn't even on my radar until I saw some lengthy discussion about it last night. They do have great RE holdings but arent monetizing it very well, still not really truely looking to add just thought I'd ask]


edit: My goal is to rotate into some value stocks b/c I'm too heavy tech and growth

edit2: I freed up some cash selling my small holdings in QQQ, Russel 2000 etf, and CIBR.. with that cash I bought a little more IHI(med devices etf), ROKU, VISA, ADBE, BRK.B and few shares of Alphabet even though I kind of missed the dip

",0.58,"['1. I\'m not buying any more Square into this. Very upset that Sarah Friar left to become CEO of Nextdoor. Dorsey was ridiculous not to make her CEO and be Chairman. Her leaving (and the announcement was totally abrupt) really throws things into question a little. This is a person that has basically acted as the CEO and the face of the company; she\'s been the one talking up the company and for her to just suddenly up and leave for a smaller social media site is not a positive sign. And you know what? I may be wrong and it may just go back up near the highs again before long. However, when someone that important to a company leaves in that manner I have to be cautious because someone talking up a company like that just deciding to go head some social media site makes me think that the Square opportunity was perhaps no longer as compelling, at least in comparison. She\'s on the board of Walmart; if this was her leaving for a role at something giant like Walmart then I\'d be maybe a little more understanding.\n\n2. ""Also what do you guys think about Macy\'s?"" Macy\'s has turned things around, but I would *not* buy something because of the dividend. Take the dividend away, do you like the business? If not, then no. People could have also pointed to Bed Bath and Beyond having a decent dividend for a while now. Meanwhile, the stock is currently below 2008 lows. What\'s the dividend done for those shareholders? That was what like $80 a few years ago?\n\n3. ROKU and ADBE are appealing IMO as long-term holdings. I really don\'t want to own FB and GOOGL has not lived up to expectations in a while; the idea that they didn\'t tell about the breach recently because they were worried about reputation and regulatory scrutiny. I think have concerns - moreso with Facebook than Google - that these companies are not appreciating the mood in regards to privacy and the possibility that regulation could appear. Facebook is also just totally tone deaf putting out that smart home camera. AMZN still like very much as a long-term holding.\n\n4. V and MA are good. I\'d rather ABT in terms of boring healthcare plays than JNJ.\n\n5. Nobody can predict the bottom. However, when you look at late January and stocks were as overbought as they have been in like 2 decades, it was a time to be cautious. When stocks become as oversold as they were in February and were yesterday, there is at least a reasonably solid chance that you\'re close to at least a short-term bottom. There may be a retest at some point. I think you have to have a long-term view and allocate in a way that fits your risk tolerance.', ""Why does everyone want to sell the loss? It makes no sense?

KEY10-18,9o9w1u,Sears files for bankruptcy,1539581074.0,639,3674,"Per CNBC - After years of [Sears Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SHLD) staying afloat through financial maneuvering and relying on billions of CEO Eddie Lampert's own money, the 125-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy.

The filing comes more than a decade after Lampert merged Sears and Kmart, hoping that forging together the two struggling discounters would create a more formidable competitor.

It comes after Lampert [shed assets and spun out real estate](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/eddie-lampert-says-sears-is-shrinking-shedding-assets-to-stay-alive.html), all to pay down the debt the retailer accumulated when that plan went askew. The company still has roughly 700 stores, which have at times been barren, unstocked by vendors who have lost their trust. Many of the stores have never been visited by a generation of shoppers that can barely recall it was once the the country's biggest retailer.

Lampert, who has a controlling ownership stake in Sears, personally holds some 31 percent of the retailer's shares outstanding, according to FactSet. His hedge fund ESL Investments owns about 19 percent.

Ultimately, it was a $134 million payment that did the company in. The company had a payment due Monday it had not the money to pay.

Other forces were at play too. Sears' creditors refused to agree to a [restructuring proposal](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/sears-ceo-proposes-restructuring-plan-to-avoid-bankruptcy.html). They had little assurance by way of collateral or strategy, after years upon years in which Sears' only shot at survival came by selling off parts of its business. Over 42 quarters, only one yielded positive same-store sales growth. As of late September, Sears tallied $5.6 billion in current debt.

Its board was in a perilous spot. Its special committee was tasked with approving Lampert's other plan, [a bid to buy his storied Kenmore appliance business and other brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/eddie-lamperts-hedge-fund-esl-proposes-to-buy-kenmore-brand-sears-real-estate.html). Approving his offer would have helped Sears make its payment. But it would also thrust the board the spotlight, potentially opening them to the threat of litigation from shareholders who might allege Lampert has stripped the business bare.

#### Homes to Hardware

That business was once a giant. It started with Richard Sears, [who launched the Sears Watch Co. in 1886](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html) to sell watches by mail. The company later evolved into Sears, Roebuck and Co., which sold everything from homes to hardware through a catalog. The convenience brought its products to America's most rural locations.

In 1925, Sears morphed a mail-order plant on Chicago's West Side into its first retail store. By the end of the year. Sears opened seven more stores. Eventually, Sears became the largest U.S. retailer, and its house brands like Kenmore and Craftsman earned spots as staples in homes across the country. Generations of children marked the holidays by paging through its holiday catalog, known as the ""Wishbook,"" wondering if they would receive any of the toys inside.

As Sears success grew, so did its empire. It moved into Chicago's iconic Sears Tower, and for a time, owned financial services businesses like Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group.

But [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) topped Sears as the biggest U.S. retailer in 1990. Its efforts to attract female shoppers by showing them the ""softer side of Sears"" and move into new businesses lines left it without a identity.

Those challenges didn't stop Lampert, the hedge fund manager who had already impressed Wall Street with his acumen when he seemingly turned around Kmart, which he bought in 2004. He acquired and combined Sears with Kmart in 2005, arguing that two ailing retailers were stronger together than apart. The financial guru saw valuable real estate, customers he could parlay from one store to the other and ample costs to cut.

The retail giant he created had a market capitalization north of $20 billion in 2006. The media began to wonder whether he was the ""next Warren Buffett."" Lampert could have sold off his investments then, but stayed on, steadfast in his vision of the combined retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) kept opening stores, as did [Lowe's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LOW)and [Home Depot](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HD). Walmart touted its ""everyday low prices,"" while Target served up ""cheap chic."" Lowe's and Home Depot provided a wider array of home improvement products for all kinds of projects, making it tough for Kenmore and Craftsman to compete.

Then, came a double blow.

Consumer spending slowed during the Great Recession, especially for big-ticket items like washers and dryers. Cash-strapped shoppers began using the internet to hunt down the best deals. Gradually, they began to spend more online and avoid the mall, fueling Amazon's rise. Sears' 140,000-square-foot stores began to seem monstrous as foot traffic declined.

Walmart and others began to invest in their businesses to compete with Amazon, but Sears never had that chance. It simply didn't have the funds.

Sears' last profitable year was in 2010. A thinning cash flow has left little money to put back into the company itself, letting it become more irrelevant. For the past five years, the ratio of Sears' capital expenditures to sales has been less than one percent. That's even as its sales have more than halved in the same time period.

Sears has been in survival mode for more than a decade. Unable to rely on the Sears' business to pay the bills, [Lampert instead sold or spun off many of its most valuable stores and brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html).

Since its merger with Kmart, Sears has spun off its Lands' End clothing brand, sold the Craftsman tool brand to [Stanley Black & Decker](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/) and closed hundreds of stores. It spun out 250 of its best properties into real estate investment trust offshoot known as [Seritage](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SRG).

Its key vendors, wary of Sears' future, [demanded tighter payment terms](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/08/sears-same-store-sales-q3-2017.html). Some, like Whirlpool, [stopped shipping all-together.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/sears-cuts-ties-with-whirlpool-and-will-stop-selling-its-appliances.html)

It has been grappling with a pension of roughly 100,000 retirees that, as of January 2018, was underfunded by $1.5 billion, according FactSet.

It became a guessing game among analysts and onlookers whether each of Sears' last five holiday seasons would be its last. But Lampert kept surprising them, extending a lifeline in the form of loans from his hedge fund ESL Investments, or finding them elsewhere, each time bankruptcy looked inevitable.

Lampert, though, sounded the alarm in a Sept. 13 [blog post](https://blog.searsholdings.com/eddie-lampert/update-on-our-transformation/). He pleaded for Sears' creditor's to agree to restructure, calling out the risks should they drag their feet.

""We continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern, rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value,"" he wrote.

By early October, it became evident that Sears' last Christmas before bankruptcy had already passed. Sears began to [raise emergency financing to support the business through coming filing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/sears-arranges-financing-for-a-potential-bankruptcy.html).

Now, the question will be whether Sears will be able to come out of bankruptcy. [Retailers don't have a great track record of emerging](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/here-are-the-retailers-that-have-filed-for-bankruptcy-so-far-this-year.html).

To top it all off, the back corner of the section was a blind spot, so even if the did walk in without it then leave with it, our policy for stopping shoplifters said we needed to have the selection and concealment on camera and we couldn't do anything about it without dancing on the line. \n\nThe biggest thing that didn't make sense to me was we were discouraged to stop shoplifters that stole anything worth $20 or less.

However, I'm weighted down in terms of returns due to the dividend withholding tax for non-us investors.\n\nFor those who are not familiar, for foreign investors whose country has no tax treaty with the US (like mine), we are subjected to 30% dividend withholding tax, but we are not taxed in capital gain.\n\nSo currently my strategy is to buy Ireland domiciled ETFS, such as VUSD, as it only has 15% dividend withholding tax.\n\nAs I have no imminent need for regular dividend income, I was considering to purchase ETFs with low dividend payout so I get taxed less, and i maximize my returns on capital growth instead.\n\nMy questions to all the more knowledgeable ETF investors are \n1. Is my strategy sound, am I mistaken in any aspect? \n2. What low expense ratio, low dividend paying dividend ETFS do you guys recommend? I'm currently only holding VUSD.\n\nMany thanks!\n"", ""What are your strategies for cheap dividend stocks (under $200 a share)\n\nI'm just under 30 with a family. \nStill learning, using non savings to buy small stock amounts, $500 or under budget at a time, once a year spending money permitting.

PG10-19,9q2wsp,How does it work,1540122326.0,8,1,"I have got one question. How does the commision when you are buying work. Lets say commision is 5 dollars for trade. Does it mean that:

2. you pay for whole trade 5 dollars       apple, PG, T = 5 dollars",0.57,"['In any given trade you were only dealing with a single company’s symbol. The commission for stocks is per trade, so it would be similar to your first scenario, where you would pay a total of $15 in order to buy all three of those stocks.', 'There are some brokerages with special deals to have one commission for a mix of stocks.  But ordinary brokerages make you order one stock at a time and pay one commission per order per day on which that order transacts.  \n  \nA given order for a single stock usually transacts entirely on one day.  If it is a limit order, it often fills in several small parts, sometimes hours apart. All those parts of one order that occur in one day are covered by one commission.  But a limit order on a thinly traded stock might fill in parts over multiple days, so each day with a nonzero part costs another commission.  AAPL, PG and T are certainly not thinly traded, so a retail customer limit order filling in parts across multiple days is almost impossible.  On a given day the order would either fill entirely or not at all.  (of course ""almost impossible"" doesn\'t mean ""impossible"").']"

Similarly, maybe they had delayed some costs somehow, reduced capex, or any number of other items that would impede future growth, but reduce costs this quarter and thus reduce the magnitude of the miss.\n\nThere's another key aspect that you may be missing here:\n\nThe stock price is based on what the market is expecting. Public analyst expectations are not necessarily as important as you think. If the analysts were expecting $1 EPS and the company came out with $0.99, but the market expected $1.5, then you're still going to see a drop.\n\nAnd for similar reasons to the above, sometimes a stock will beat and still drop.

VFC10-19,9n31xf,Introducing the White Girl Index,1539202369.0,627,3686,"I talked about the idea [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9mvabs/z/e7htx2q), and it's a simple one, but potentially lucrative.

Intuitively it makes sense; these are customers with money and the ability to set cultural trends. Here is the American white girl index as I currently have it:

If we add foreign stocks, we can include these:

* DEO

* LRLCY

* LVMUY

I simply forgot about it, but even if I didn't, it's been public for such a short time that it would screw up any decent backtest, and I would probably not include a company with no history of positive EPS anyways.

EDIT2: In accordance with community consensus, we can go ahead and add these:

* ETSY

CDNS10-22,9qs1fc,Charlotte's Web ($CWEB / $CWBHF),1540321543.0,28,12,"I don't see any talk about this stock on this sub, so figured I'd give a quick run-down of what I like about it.

The Colorado company [Charlotte's Web](https://www.cwhemp.com/) went [IPO last month](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/charlottes-web-holdings-inc-completes-initial-public-offering-692082021.html) @ $7 CAD under the Canadian ticker $CWEB, followed by the US OTC ticker $CWBHF. The short on them is they're a CBD producer from hemp made famous by [Dr. Sanjay Gupta who used CBD to cure 5-year-old Charlotte Figi from seizures](https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/07/health/charlotte-child-medical-marijuana/index.html).

Now I know what you're thinking: shut the fuck up about Cannabis stocks it's a fucking bubble look at Tilray. And yea, I get it. But I'm going to put my info down here anyways and you can decide for yourself or down-vote me.

1. **This company doesn't sell weed**. Their products contain minimal THC and is legally sold in the US as a ""natural"" CBD product derived from hemp.

2. The CBD market [will probably](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarabrittanysomerset/2018/09/12/will-cbd-entirely-eclipse-the-cannabis-market/#27af35c97beb) be [much larger](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/new-study-cbd-market-22-billion-2022-722852/) than the THC market. As well, with recreational cannabis slowly becoming legal, it's providing a much easier avenue for people to try CBD products. In the last two years, the US market for hemp-derived CBD supplements has experienced robust growth and is expected to grow at a 55% CAGR over 2016-2021, according to the Brightfield Group ([from the cannacord report](http://cdn.ceo.ca.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1dq4vhg-CWEB%2B-%2BInitiation.pdf)).

3. CBD can help with a huge array of problems, such as anxiety (CBD oil / pills), focus (CBD tea), joint pain (CBD cream), seizures, sleep-aids, and many others.

Here's a quick break-down of their stats (3 months ended June 30th 2018):

* Retail locations: 2,700 ([now past 3000](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/cbd-leader-charlottes-web-holdings-inc-surpasses-3000-locations-as-mainstream-market-grows-697670241.html))
* Revenues: $17.2m
* Gross Profit: $13.2m
* Gross Profit Margin: 76%
* Adj EBITDA: $6.1m
* Net Income: $3.7m
* Fully Diluted Shares: 106m
* Mkt Cap: $1.47Bln
* #1 in CBD market share in the US
* **Low float** due to **insiders owning 44%** of the shares, including the Stanley Brothers (who started the company) who own 34%. The IPO lock-out is 180 days for them.
* Currently trading ~$15 CAD since their $7 IPO, with a price target of $21.

I highly recommend checking out [the Canaccord coverage of them](http://cdn.ceo.ca.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1dq4vhg-CWEB%2B-%2BInitiation.pdf) which has a huge amount of info.

**But there's no free money**, this company has risks don't get me wrong. One risk is the 2018 Farm bill which will remove hemp as a Schedule-I drug. This would help CWEB producer easier and get them out of the legal ambiguity they are in today. Another risk is if the FDA suddenly decides to crack-down on their 'health benefits' claims.

Despite the risks I think CWEB is a solid growth holding with a lot of potential, and I think their branding and products are much better than any of the competition (including $CVSI).",0.63,"['"" I think their branding and products are much better than any of the competition ""\n\nAgreed.\n\n""The CBD market will probably be much larger than the THC market.

1) The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful

2) Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its  always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually  cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months  there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler  data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.  

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom.

This is because investment in semis is very very very expensive so most companies carve out a nice product or industrial segment. Some excel in analog, some in power, some in RF, some serve mostly autos, some mobile etc. What's more is the leader in each segment usually has a considerable lead on the 2nd place.\n\nNow, you'd think this gives these companies a lot of pricing power but no.

It's already hard to make an argument for buying an Intel processor right now looking strictly at the products, they just have the mindshare and market in place that will take time to offset.

AMD10-24,9rnngz,"Understanding the SEMI cycle.MU, NVDA, AMD, TXN, $SOX",1540580891.0,14,12,"I though I would write a short post for some of the youngins here who have never experienced a real correction or know what a market cycle is. 

1) The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful

2) Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its  always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually  cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months  there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler  data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.  

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom.

The company has deeply needed a revamp of it's overseas and auto business for a while.  The whole reason this is taking a long time to materialize is largely because half of the changes the board wanted when it appointed Hackett have become non-viable options.  They wanted to move more production into Mexico and China and trade challenges have made that a complete non-go.  Some of the simplification stuff should help long term with reducing model variants and streamlining but it's going to take time to materialize.  I think their car problems were far more a problem of overall quality control.  The Fusion and Focus both sold well but you would end up with like 7-8 recalls on them within the first 5 years of ownership.  I don't think the Taurus was really doing well though.  Obviously the Mustang is doing just fine too which is why they're keeping it.  Trucks have been strong but they're highly cyclic too, driven by business purchases and have pretty limited sales options overseas.\n\nI hate to say it but Ford definitely seems like a company sliding into slow decline here at this point.

I don't blame the board or Hackett for that, but at the same time it's something they don't really have much recourse with.\n\nLower bond ratings, higher capex requirements, lower margins due to material costs and the Chinese market turning negative all point to the dividend looking less and less sustainable here.

I think we're going to see a 25% cut by or in 2019.\n\nThe company is profitable but I don't think they have a real clear path forward at this point.  Hackett was brought in to execute a specific plan that Bill Ford had and Mark Fields did not support, that plan has more or less fallen apart in a lot of ways and now Hackett has to actually figure something workable out.\n\nThe company isn't dead or screwed over but personally I really don't have much faith in the BoD at this point and I think they've way too aggresively in announcing their abandonment of the US car market and all these model launches.  They don't really have anything in the bag to tide them over other than the NA truck and SUV market and they should have at least kept some of the car lines going until they had something to actually launch in place of it.

Rather than be land developers like other home builder, Ryan buys plots from a land developer once they get a deposit from a sales contract.  They pay a small premium but they avoid having cash tied to the real estate.

Similarly, they don't tie up money in their model homes. They usually sell the home before it's built and lease it back until they are done with the area.  A family friend had bought a really nice 5,000+ sqft home for a pretty nice price and also collected rent on it for about two years.  There was some light wear so you don't get the same new construction feel but it was a trade-off they were willing to live with.

I have been looking at working with Ryan on a lease back for a while and recently ran across an offer.  Since I'm not a professional landlord, I wanted feedback for the folks here.  Ryan is offering a townhouse for $330,000 and leasing it back at 2,750/mo.  Aside from the mortgage, I am responsible for taxes and home owners insurance.  I estimate my monthly costs (mortgage, insurance, and taxes) to be ~$2,000.  I would need to bring about 85k to closing so my net ROI is about 10.5%.

Ryan would be leasing for a year with a month to month clause afterward.  The area they are building in is expected to take about two years to finish and will have a little over 100 other similar homes.  The home is on the high end of the local market but not an outlier.  My plan is to buy and lease to Ryan and decide if I want to sell or continue to rent once they are out.

That said, had anyone here had any experience doing this with Ryan or a similar builder?  Ryan is a publicly traded company (NVR) and it's in good financial health so they are good for the rent.

*BIIB098 (Formerly ALKS 8700) – Phase III for Multiple Sclerosis

*ALKS 4230 – Phase I in Immuno-oncology


Alkermes has two big FDA deadlines and events in the upcoming months which will be the focus of this write up.  The first is ALKS 5461 for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder with the FDA advisory committee discussing the NDA application for the drug candidate on November 1st as well as a PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  The second is ALKS 4230 for treatment of Solid Tumors, where they are reporting Phase I initial data in the second half of 2018.  I will be setting 2 dates for this write up to remind investors of the Advisory Meeting/data presentation sometime in the next 2 months, as well as the PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  With multiple catalysts in the pipeline in the next 3 months, Alkermes is an exciting company to watch.


**Specific Drugs:**

**ALKS 5461**

AKLS 5461, buprenorphine/samidorphan, is a k-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist which functions as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).  The buprenorphine is a partial agonist of µ-opioid receptors (MOR), antagonist of the KOR, as well as a slight antagonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and a weak agonist of the nociception receptor (NOP).  Samidorphan on the other hand is a preferential antagonist of the MOR, allowing for the combination of the two to function as a stopper to KORs with negligible activation of MORs.  
Essentially this means that by activating the KOR, opioid peptides which are endogenous ligands of the KOR and function by inversing morphine-like, euphoric endorphins, create a sense of dysphoria and psychotomimetic effects, and are to produce changes in neuroplasticity evoked by chronic stress that has led to the development of depression and CNS disorders and drug addiction.  It is suggested in research that inhibiting the KOR abolishes antidepressant-like effects of buprenorphine, but the drug exhibits both antagonistic and agonist properties.  This has led to the concern that in theory, ALKS-5461 could be limited in the effectiveness of treatment of depression.  

Granted a Fast Track Designation in 2013, the drug has proceeded up to Phase III where thee different trials were initiated for the treatment of depression.  The first two trials failed in 2016, FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, however based on the third trial, FORWARD-5, the company submitted an NDA in 2017 for ALKS-5461.  Things started to look grim for the company moving forward, as the FDA served Alkermes a refuse-to-file letter saying that more data from well-controlled clinical trials must be presented before an application would be recognized.  However, just two weeks after serving the notice, the FDA rescinded their letter and accepted the NDA after productive interactions with Alkermes where the company clarified certain aspects of the NDA.  No further data was needed to rescind the letter and PDUFA date is scheduled by January 31, 2019.

The first two trials failed after the company reported higher placebo responses as the chief obstacle in their studies.  Not something a company would like to hear in relation to an antidepressant medication.  Causing the stock to plummet 44% in 2016, from nearly $80 to under $40, the company has been slowly recovering since.  ALKS-5461’s fate lies in the hands of FORWARD-5, without a clear success and perfect data, an FDA approval seems unlikely for this drug. 

FORWARD-5 focused on two doses of 1mg/1mg and 2mg/2mg of ALKS-5461 for adjunct treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).  Concurrently to taking ALKS-5461, the patients also remained on background antidepressant therapy.  With 407 patients enrolled, 63 received 1mg/1mg, 63 received 2mg/2mg, and 280 received the placebo.  The study was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 was 5 weeks, Stage 2 was 6 weeks. In Stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. For Stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. Depression scores were assessed using the 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) and MADRS-10, an assessment tool for depression.

In the study, ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by 6-item MADRS scores (p=0.018). ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 10-item MADRS scores compared to placebo (p=0.026). The 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS-5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo.  2mg/2mg treatment did show a significant change, warranting its efficacy while also having no incidences of withdrawal or pattern of adverse effects suggesting abuse potential.  The clinical benefit of the compound maintained through 11-week study and the compound is relatively safe and tolerable.  Where FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 failed to meet their endpoints, FORWARD-5 succeed in meeting primary endpoint for the 2mg/2mg dose, showing great efficacy when compared to a placebo.   
November 1st, 2018, the FDA advisory committee is meeting to discuss ALKS-5471 in relation to the compound’s efficacy, safety and risk-benefit profile of the NDA for buprenorphine and samidorphan sublingual tablets for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.  In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee roughly 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  

**ALKS-4230**

Currently in Phase I of development, Alkermes does a change of pace with this immuno-oncology drug for the treatment of solid tumors, making a shift away from their regular market in the CNS disease space.  This drug candidate is an engineered fusion protein comprised of permuted interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 Receptor (IL-2R) α made specifically to only activate the intermediate-affinity IL-2R.  The intermediate-affinity IL-2R is expressed mainly on effector lymphocytes, which are essential in generating an antitumor immune response.  IL-2 is a cell signaling molecule which plays a role in controlling the life cycle of specialized T-cells.  ALKS-4230 selectively binds to intermediate-affinity IL-2R to both activate and increase in number the immune cells that work to battle cancer.  Their selectivity, however, means they don’t bind to the “high-affinity IL-2 receptor,” so as not to trigger greater activity or proliferation in immune cells that could dampen an anti-tumor response Research has suggested that selective activation of the intermediate-affinity IL-2R by ALKS-4230 has the potential to provide enhanced tumor killing as well as improved tolerability. 
ALKS-4230 is currently in Phase I in patients with advanced solid tumors. Key study objectives are to determine a recommended phase 2 dose and characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and evidence of antitumor activity. A dose-escalation phase in patients with refractory solid tumors (Part A) will be followed by expansion cohorts in defined populations (Part B). ALKS 4230 is administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for five days each cycle. The dose will be escalated until reaching maximum tolerated dose or an Optimal Biologic Dose. The first two dose cohorts will use a 3+3 design. Subsequent cohorts in Part A will enroll a minimum of 6 subjects. In Part B up to 21 patients will be enrolled into each of four tumor-specific cohorts. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for PK, immunogenicity and PD assessments. The primary PD endpoint is change-from-baseline in CD8+ T, NK and T reg cell counts. Other PD measures include serum concentrations of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and immunohistochemical assessment of markers of immune activation in tumor tissue from selected patients. 

Animal trials conducted previously were positive and showed the anti-tumor activity of ALKS-4230, both alone and with the checkpoint inhibitors. Rodents treated with ALKS-4230 were seen to have lesser tumor growth and better survival, supporting clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 as a potential immunotherapy in the oncology space. ALKS-4230 will be administered in combination with PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells, complimenting the mechanisms of action from ALKS-4230.  Alkermes has accelerated clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab based on data from the ongoing monotherapy dose-escalation stage of the phase 1 study, where ALKS 4230 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on circulating natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells, and minimal and non-dose dependent effects on immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.  

Initial data from Phase I is due in the second half of 2018, estimated to come out early November.


**Competition and Market:**

ALKS-4230 is a tough market, cancer is a hot sector but it continually sees failure.  While the FDA holds the stance that they want to try to push new oncology and immuno-oncology drugs through the approval process and get them to market to potentially save or extend lives, their decisions tend to skew otherwise.  Being so early on in development, it’s not necessary to dive into the market in depth as there is a large, unmet need in the oncology sector with the main focus being in immuno-oncology.

MDD has a multifaceted and varied etiology, and remains poorly understood. The MDD market is overly crowded and overly competitive, surpassing 30 FDA approved products available for the treatment of patients, the majority of which are now available as inexpensive generics. The MDD market is currently in an active transition where patents are expiring on top-selling products such as Eli Lilly's Cymbalta and Otsuka/BMS' Abilify, paving way for launches of Lundbeck/Takeda's Trintellix and Otsuka/Lundbeck's Rexulti.  These will create a significant growth in the market as cheaper generics will become available.  Growth in the MDD market is also expected to be driven by the potential introduction of numerous promising late-stage pipeline products into the market during the next few years which are directed at treatment-resistant patients.  These products include Alkermes' ALKS-5461, Allergan/Gedeon Richter/Mitsubishi Tanabe's Vraylar, Axsome Therapeutics' AXS-05, Janssen's esketamine, and Allergan's rapastinel.

MDD is the most common mental disorder in the U.S., affecting approximately 16 million American adults, of which about one-third remain untreated. The number of treated patients is projected to rise on account of expiring patents, the increase in available generic products, and rising awareness regarding depression and mental health issues.  This competitive market was priced at a massive $3.2 billion in 2015 and is expected to consistently grow at a CAGR of 6.1% until 2025 to reach $5.8 billion.  With the current social standings of mental health, students being required to take mandatory mental health courses now in many places, and social workers and therapists being more commonplace in schools and work places, we should see a larger surge in my opinion.  Growing female prevalence, increase in prescription spending, and escalating awareness of mental health will propel the growth of this market for many years to come.


**Financials:**

Alkermes has a great financial standing in the biotech industry.  Leveraging both their approved products and impressive collaborations, the company was able to boast a revenue growth of 39% ($304.6 million) through product sales and payments.  Many opportunities lined up for the company and set them up for success this second quarter. 

*Vivitrol sales increased 15% to $76.2 million

*Aristada sales increased 48% to $33.6 million

*Royalties from Johnson & Johnson partnership increased 4% to $85.2 million

*Royalties from Acorda Therapeutics decreased 22% to $19.7 million

*License revenue from Biogen generated $48.3 million in revenue


Despite increased operation costs related to commercializing their products and further research and development, the company posted a Non-GAAP net income of $45.6 million and a Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29. With a total cash balance of $561 million and total debt of $280 million, the company stands on strong ground.  This second half of 2018 has several catalysts, combined with increasing revenues from collaborations and drug approvals, Alkermes is likely to see success, only to be complimented by hopefully positive data from their upcoming Phase I and PDUFA dates. The company is expecting to hit $1 billion in revenues for 2018 as a year, which would be a massive milestone for the pharmaceutical company.


**Review:**

Historically, the FDA has been flexible with depression medications, but failures will weigh Alkermes down.  Depression studies have had a flurry of failures over recent history, and failure here can dissuade further research in the pharmaceutical space until more is known on the biology side.  With over 30 currently approved products on the market for MDD, it is overly saturated and failure can spell the end for the drug.  Following their failures in FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, investors are weary of another failure, especially after the initial NDA was rejected.  Good news is, there is an advisory committee meeting in November to discuss ALKS-5461. In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee only about 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  Chances are from that perspective that the FDA will grant approval.  The compound also shows no suggestion of tolerance of therapeutic effects, the side effect profile was generally comparable to standard medications with no significant late appearing side effects, and when medication was halted there was no sign of opioid withdrawal.  With the competitive, growing market and patents expiring, a new and novel MDD treatment would be a value add.

In the case of the early stage ALKS-4230, oncology drug candidates historically have a 57% possibility of success moving from Phase I to Phase II compared to an industry average of 63.2% possibility of success.  This does shine in comparison to the oncology end success rate of a low 3.4%.  If I were to put my money where my mouth is, I am going with the data and not the suggestive words of the FDA to say that oncology might sound like a great industry with the backing of the FDA, but their actions prove otherwise.  Oncology drugs are more likely to be denied by the FDA and fail their clinical trials at much higher rates than other industries such as vaccines which show an end rate of success over 30%.  I would guess this drug might make it to Phase III with time, but statistically it is unlikely to see approval.  While Phase III or even Phase II are years away from completion, the data in Phase I will likely reveal a lot about the drug to make future estimations off of.  I see Phase I being positive.

Currently the stock is trading around $43 and showing a high level of support and consolidation in this zone.  With a high of over $70 not 7 months ago, the company is likely to recover and soar.  This stock does not take bad news well however, seeing several 10% or more drops over the past year, but never going under $40 for long.  I think between $42-46 are great entries for this stock.  Long term their finances are growing, increasing revenues from royalties and sales of their own approved products, on track to hit $1 billion in revenues this year, and a solid pipeline that shows great promise.  I would bank on good data from ALKS-4230 as well as a positive hearing from the advisory committee.  With the PDUFA date in January, we will see a heavy run up into the end of the year.  I would take advantage of this price entry for either a long-term hold or a swing trade.  I would predict levels of up to $55 in the coming 3 months.  


#**TLDR**

Shit will pop off in the next 3 months, I expect about 30-40% move by January 2019.  I am buying.

BWA10-25,9rnngz,"Understanding the SEMI cycle.MU, NVDA, AMD, TXN, $SOX",1540580891.0,14,14,"I though I would write a short post for some of the youngins here who have never experienced a real correction or know what a market cycle is. 

1) The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful

2) Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its  always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually  cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months  there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler  data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.  

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom. 

Happy trading

Let me fill you in some, because there is alot of misconception with Micron and it is trading based off of pure fear. SK Hynix said on the call the expect DRAM price INCREASES to be weaker over the next 2 Qs. Most likely ASP increases of 0-1%. They also said the feel prices might start to move back up in 2H '19 due to large demand increases. So what is going on here? Is there actually a demand problem as you say? Seems the opposite from their call. The media/analysts running around with their heads cut off screaming the end of the world for memory/semis. The DRAM industry is an Oligopoly now. Totally controlled by 3 compaines that will have 100% incentive to not over produce like old times. Good luck, stay up to date with SK Hynix/Samsung calls"", '[deleted]', 'What you’re missing is that prices for memory always go down on a long term scale. But what also goes is cost of production.

Blockchain is a super expensive way to decentralize things and it isn’t even reliable if enough of the mining capacity is centralized like it has been in China and Russia as the article pointed out.  It was never going to change the world in the way it’s advocates stated and frankly it’s a prine example of how people had been overvaluing abstract ideas like “vision” in the emerging tech industry.

IP10-25,9mg4xx,Understanding Key Executive Relationships between Companies,1539014488.0,2,4,"Let me know if this is not the right place to post this and I'll move it! I just thought this group of people might be able to help me understand this issue further:

I am looking into a small cable company, Cable One (NYSE: CABO). They provide cable services in rural America.

They recently replaced their CFO with a guy named Steven Scott Cochran. *Note: if you google him, he is not the Steven Scott Cochran who happens to be the same age and is currently serving jail time for robbing a woman at gunpoint. At least, not to my knowledge.*

Anyways, Cochran came to Cable One from a competing company, WideOpenWest (NYSE:WOW) where he was CEO.

Cochran still holds about $6MM worth of WOW stock and (from what I can tell) is still serving as the CEO of WideOpenWest's subsidiary, WideOpenWest Networks. He is also serving as President at Sigecom, another subsidiary of WOW. Lastly, Cochran is serves as CEO at another competing company, IpTel Direct.

CableOne, WideOpenWest, and IpTel Direct all compete with each other. IpTel Direct isn't publicly traded, however, CableOne and WOW each recognize each other as competitors in their annual reports. My first instinct was that IpTel was a subsidiary of WOW, however, I can't find any information on them at all beyond my terminal. Even their website says the IP address can't be found. To make things worse, the registered address of IpTel is one of those rent-an-address ""virtual"" locations, so it's not even a real office.

So I felt a little weird about this. Firstly, because it seems that Cochran is going to be really busy holding all of those roles. And secondly because of the inherent conflict of interest from serving in all of these positions.

I've never seen such strong competitor overlap before and I'm not quite sure what to make of it. Is this type of overlap typical amongst smaller companies in niche industries? If it is, how do you get comfortable investing with an executive serving in two roles (or more)? Could it be an indicator of a potential merger between CableOne and WOW? Alternatively, is this just raising enough red flags to land a plane?

&#x200B;

**Bonus:**

There's lot of other overlap between executives too, which makes me think this is more common than I expected-

WOW CFO Rich Fish (best name ever) also serves as CFO for IpTel and ICG Telecom, both of which are WOW competitors.

Catherin Kuo, IpTel's COO is also the head of marketing at Sigecom and is a ""senior key executive"" at WOW.

Cash Hagen, IpTel's CTO is also the COO at WideOpenWest Network (not the parent company, the subsidiary that Cochran also works for)

Donald Martin is the Chief Legal Officer for IpTel and WOW (and WOW subsidiaries)

&#x200B;

**Extra Bonus:** 

I am using the CapIQ terminal, in case anyone is curious. The phone number listed for IpTel Direct is the same phone number listed for all the key executives, including Cochran, above. The phone number is a Geeker support phone number. When I called they said they have no clue who/what IpTel Direct was and that they were a call center. ",0.67,"['It\'s interesting that you\'ve found that, but I would not read too much into it based on CapIQ info - a lot of the more qualitative stuff is often stale, especially for small companies. \n\nI just looked up a couple of my bosses on CapIQ hat are on boards of public companies and their data isn\'t fully up to date. \n\nIt\'s worth noting that companies usually have lots of ""boxes"" in their corporate structure, all of which need a board/officers in name only. So this guy might still just be on the board in theory, but it doesn\'t have any real power. \n\nThat said, there may be more to it, but I didn\'t dive too deep into the specific details you raised. ', 'That\'s interesting! I\'ve actually been looking into similar stories recently of teams of execs moving into a new company.\n\nThere\'s a few main scenarios and possible outcomes:  \n\n\n1. The team is a super group, they see an opportunity and go in to transform it and sell it quickly (1-3 years).\n\n2. They\'re looking to buy and finalize the transaction, within 4-5 months usually goes private. \n\n\nThese two scenarios are fairly similar in operation, slightly different time frames.\n\n  \n\n\nPandora (P) is a perfect recent example by the way. I think it was 5 months from when they started showing up in management to the company\'s sale. John Malone and his crew are awesome.\n\n  \n\n\n3. It\'s a pump and dump crew. But they usually join crappy companies. This doesn\'t seem like that.\n\n  \n\n\n4. CEO moves, gets their bearings, and within a year or two brings over the CFO and board owing to an ""aha"" moment.\n\n  \n\n\nThats the main ones I\'ve seen. I am not sure exactly which of these scenarios is most accurate but the quick sale seems like it could be a possibility. Interesting company for sure, they\'re gaining market share too while WOW seems to be in steady decline?']"

Positioning their company with strategic partnerships, Alkermes has developed collaborations with some of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies to help generate new and innovative medicines.   A partial list of Alkermes partnerships include Biogen, AstraZeneca, Janssen, Acorda, and Acceleron.  

Richard Pops, the Chairman and CEO of Alkermes, has been CEO of the company since 1991.  Since taking over the company, he has grown the company from a small private company of 25 employees to a powerhouse biopharmaceutical company with more than 2,000 employees.  Currently serving on the board of directors of Neurocrine Biosciences, Acceleron Pharma, Epizyme, the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, and the National Health Council.  Pops brings quite an impressive background to the table, with almost 30 years as CEO of his current company and aiding in improving several others, he displays a track record of success. 

The company also focuses on their responsibility in all aspects of the word.  Alkermes supports educational, healthcare-related, and public policy events through partnerships and donations which are aimed at central nervous system disorders such as depression and schizophrenia.  Contributing to individual education by providing educational grants, Alkermes focus lies on activities which improve patient care and public health in CNS disorders.  Committed to their patients and furthering the field of medicine, Alkermes remains a leader in treatments for CNS disorders.

*BIIB098 (Formerly ALKS 8700) – Phase III for Multiple Sclerosis

*ALKS 4230 – Phase I in Immuno-oncology


Alkermes has two big FDA deadlines and events in the upcoming months which will be the focus of this write up.  The first is ALKS 5461 for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder with the FDA advisory committee discussing the NDA application for the drug candidate on November 1st as well as a PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  The second is ALKS 4230 for treatment of Solid Tumors, where they are reporting Phase I initial data in the second half of 2018.  I will be setting 2 dates for this write up to remind investors of the Advisory Meeting/data presentation sometime in the next 2 months, as well as the PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  With multiple catalysts in the pipeline in the next 3 months, Alkermes is an exciting company to watch.


**Specific Drugs:**

**ALKS 5461**

AKLS 5461, buprenorphine/samidorphan, is a k-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist which functions as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).  The buprenorphine is a partial agonist of µ-opioid receptors (MOR), antagonist of the KOR, as well as a slight antagonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and a weak agonist of the nociception receptor (NOP).  Samidorphan on the other hand is a preferential antagonist of the MOR, allowing for the combination of the two to function as a stopper to KORs with negligible activation of MORs.  
Essentially this means that by activating the KOR, opioid peptides which are endogenous ligands of the KOR and function by inversing morphine-like, euphoric endorphins, create a sense of dysphoria and psychotomimetic effects, and are to produce changes in neuroplasticity evoked by chronic stress that has led to the development of depression and CNS disorders and drug addiction.  It is suggested in research that inhibiting the KOR abolishes antidepressant-like effects of buprenorphine, but the drug exhibits both antagonistic and agonist properties.  This has led to the concern that in theory, ALKS-5461 could be limited in the effectiveness of treatment of depression.  

Granted a Fast Track Designation in 2013, the drug has proceeded up to Phase III where thee different trials were initiated for the treatment of depression.  The first two trials failed in 2016, FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, however based on the third trial, FORWARD-5, the company submitted an NDA in 2017 for ALKS-5461.  Things started to look grim for the company moving forward, as the FDA served Alkermes a refuse-to-file letter saying that more data from well-controlled clinical trials must be presented before an application would be recognized.  However, just two weeks after serving the notice, the FDA rescinded their letter and accepted the NDA after productive interactions with Alkermes where the company clarified certain aspects of the NDA.  No further data was needed to rescind the letter and PDUFA date is scheduled by January 31, 2019.

The first two trials failed after the company reported higher placebo responses as the chief obstacle in their studies.  Not something a company would like to hear in relation to an antidepressant medication.  Causing the stock to plummet 44% in 2016, from nearly $80 to under $40, the company has been slowly recovering since.  ALKS-5461’s fate lies in the hands of FORWARD-5, without a clear success and perfect data, an FDA approval seems unlikely for this drug. 

FORWARD-5 focused on two doses of 1mg/1mg and 2mg/2mg of ALKS-5461 for adjunct treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).  Concurrently to taking ALKS-5461, the patients also remained on background antidepressant therapy.  With 407 patients enrolled, 63 received 1mg/1mg, 63 received 2mg/2mg, and 280 received the placebo.  The study was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 was 5 weeks, Stage 2 was 6 weeks. In Stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. For Stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. Depression scores were assessed using the 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) and MADRS-10, an assessment tool for depression.

In the study, ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by 6-item MADRS scores (p=0.018). ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 10-item MADRS scores compared to placebo (p=0.026). The 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS-5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo.  2mg/2mg treatment did show a significant change, warranting its efficacy while also having no incidences of withdrawal or pattern of adverse effects suggesting abuse potential.  The clinical benefit of the compound maintained through 11-week study and the compound is relatively safe and tolerable.  Where FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 failed to meet their endpoints, FORWARD-5 succeed in meeting primary endpoint for the 2mg/2mg dose, showing great efficacy when compared to a placebo.   
November 1st, 2018, the FDA advisory committee is meeting to discuss ALKS-5471 in relation to the compound’s efficacy, safety and risk-benefit profile of the NDA for buprenorphine and samidorphan sublingual tablets for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.  In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee roughly 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  

**ALKS-4230**

Currently in Phase I of development, Alkermes does a change of pace with this immuno-oncology drug for the treatment of solid tumors, making a shift away from their regular market in the CNS disease space.  This drug candidate is an engineered fusion protein comprised of permuted interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 Receptor (IL-2R) α made specifically to only activate the intermediate-affinity IL-2R.  The intermediate-affinity IL-2R is expressed mainly on effector lymphocytes, which are essential in generating an antitumor immune response.  IL-2 is a cell signaling molecule which plays a role in controlling the life cycle of specialized T-cells.  ALKS-4230 selectively binds to intermediate-affinity IL-2R to both activate and increase in number the immune cells that work to battle cancer.  Their selectivity, however, means they don’t bind to the “high-affinity IL-2 receptor,” so as not to trigger greater activity or proliferation in immune cells that could dampen an anti-tumor response Research has suggested that selective activation of the intermediate-affinity IL-2R by ALKS-4230 has the potential to provide enhanced tumor killing as well as improved tolerability. 
ALKS-4230 is currently in Phase I in patients with advanced solid tumors. Key study objectives are to determine a recommended phase 2 dose and characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and evidence of antitumor activity. A dose-escalation phase in patients with refractory solid tumors (Part A) will be followed by expansion cohorts in defined populations (Part B). ALKS 4230 is administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for five days each cycle. The dose will be escalated until reaching maximum tolerated dose or an Optimal Biologic Dose. The first two dose cohorts will use a 3+3 design. Subsequent cohorts in Part A will enroll a minimum of 6 subjects. In Part B up to 21 patients will be enrolled into each of four tumor-specific cohorts. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for PK, immunogenicity and PD assessments. The primary PD endpoint is change-from-baseline in CD8+ T, NK and T reg cell counts. Other PD measures include serum concentrations of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and immunohistochemical assessment of markers of immune activation in tumor tissue from selected patients. 

Animal trials conducted previously were positive and showed the anti-tumor activity of ALKS-4230, both alone and with the checkpoint inhibitors. Rodents treated with ALKS-4230 were seen to have lesser tumor growth and better survival, supporting clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 as a potential immunotherapy in the oncology space. ALKS-4230 will be administered in combination with PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells, complimenting the mechanisms of action from ALKS-4230.  Alkermes has accelerated clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab based on data from the ongoing monotherapy dose-escalation stage of the phase 1 study, where ALKS 4230 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on circulating natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells, and minimal and non-dose dependent effects on immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.  

Initial data from Phase I is due in the second half of 2018, estimated to come out early November.


**Competition and Market:**

ALKS-4230 is a tough market, cancer is a hot sector but it continually sees failure.  While the FDA holds the stance that they want to try to push new oncology and immuno-oncology drugs through the approval process and get them to market to potentially save or extend lives, their decisions tend to skew otherwise.  Being so early on in development, it’s not necessary to dive into the market in depth as there is a large, unmet need in the oncology sector with the main focus being in immuno-oncology.

MDD has a multifaceted and varied etiology, and remains poorly understood. The MDD market is overly crowded and overly competitive, surpassing 30 FDA approved products available for the treatment of patients, the majority of which are now available as inexpensive generics. The MDD market is currently in an active transition where patents are expiring on top-selling products such as Eli Lilly's Cymbalta and Otsuka/BMS' Abilify, paving way for launches of Lundbeck/Takeda's Trintellix and Otsuka/Lundbeck's Rexulti.  These will create a significant growth in the market as cheaper generics will become available.  Growth in the MDD market is also expected to be driven by the potential introduction of numerous promising late-stage pipeline products into the market during the next few years which are directed at treatment-resistant patients.  These products include Alkermes' ALKS-5461, Allergan/Gedeon Richter/Mitsubishi Tanabe's Vraylar, Axsome Therapeutics' AXS-05, Janssen's esketamine, and Allergan's rapastinel.

MDD is the most common mental disorder in the U.S., affecting approximately 16 million American adults, of which about one-third remain untreated. The number of treated patients is projected to rise on account of expiring patents, the increase in available generic products, and rising awareness regarding depression and mental health issues.  This competitive market was priced at a massive $3.2 billion in 2015 and is expected to consistently grow at a CAGR of 6.1% until 2025 to reach $5.8 billion.  With the current social standings of mental health, students being required to take mandatory mental health courses now in many places, and social workers and therapists being more commonplace in schools and work places, we should see a larger surge in my opinion.  Growing female prevalence, increase in prescription spending, and escalating awareness of mental health will propel the growth of this market for many years to come.


**Financials:**

Alkermes has a great financial standing in the biotech industry.  Leveraging both their approved products and impressive collaborations, the company was able to boast a revenue growth of 39% ($304.6 million) through product sales and payments.  Many opportunities lined up for the company and set them up for success this second quarter. 

*Vivitrol sales increased 15% to $76.2 million

*Aristada sales increased 48% to $33.6 million

*Royalties from Johnson & Johnson partnership increased 4% to $85.2 million

*Royalties from Acorda Therapeutics decreased 22% to $19.7 million

*License revenue from Biogen generated $48.3 million in revenue


Despite increased operation costs related to commercializing their products and further research and development, the company posted a Non-GAAP net income of $45.6 million and a Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29. With a total cash balance of $561 million and total debt of $280 million, the company stands on strong ground.  This second half of 2018 has several catalysts, combined with increasing revenues from collaborations and drug approvals, Alkermes is likely to see success, only to be complimented by hopefully positive data from their upcoming Phase I and PDUFA dates. The company is expecting to hit $1 billion in revenues for 2018 as a year, which would be a massive milestone for the pharmaceutical company.


**Review:**

Historically, the FDA has been flexible with depression medications, but failures will weigh Alkermes down.  Depression studies have had a flurry of failures over recent history, and failure here can dissuade further research in the pharmaceutical space until more is known on the biology side.  With over 30 currently approved products on the market for MDD, it is overly saturated and failure can spell the end for the drug.  Following their failures in FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, investors are weary of another failure, especially after the initial NDA was rejected.  Good news is, there is an advisory committee meeting in November to discuss ALKS-5461. In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee only about 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  Chances are from that perspective that the FDA will grant approval.  The compound also shows no suggestion of tolerance of therapeutic effects, the side effect profile was generally comparable to standard medications with no significant late appearing side effects, and when medication was halted there was no sign of opioid withdrawal.  With the competitive, growing market and patents expiring, a new and novel MDD treatment would be a value add.

In the case of the early stage ALKS-4230, oncology drug candidates historically have a 57% possibility of success moving from Phase I to Phase II compared to an industry average of 63.2% possibility of success.  This does shine in comparison to the oncology end success rate of a low 3.4%.  If I were to put my money where my mouth is, I am going with the data and not the suggestive words of the FDA to say that oncology might sound like a great industry with the backing of the FDA, but their actions prove otherwise.  Oncology drugs are more likely to be denied by the FDA and fail their clinical trials at much higher rates than other industries such as vaccines which show an end rate of success over 30%.  I would guess this drug might make it to Phase III with time, but statistically it is unlikely to see approval.  While Phase III or even Phase II are years away from completion, the data in Phase I will likely reveal a lot about the drug to make future estimations off of.  I see Phase I being positive.

Currently the stock is trading around $43 and showing a high level of support and consolidation in this zone.  With a high of over $70 not 7 months ago, the company is likely to recover and soar.  This stock does not take bad news well however, seeing several 10% or more drops over the past year, but never going under $40 for long.  I think between $42-46 are great entries for this stock.  Long term their finances are growing, increasing revenues from royalties and sales of their own approved products, on track to hit $1 billion in revenues this year, and a solid pipeline that shows great promise.  I would bank on good data from ALKS-4230 as well as a positive hearing from the advisory committee.  With the PDUFA date in January, we will see a heavy run up into the end of the year.  I would take advantage of this price entry for either a long-term hold or a swing trade.  I would predict levels of up to $55 in the coming 3 months.  


#**TLDR**

Shit will pop off in the next 3 months, I expect about 30-40% move by January 2019.  I am buying.

Again plugging my shitty site.

DLR10-25,9k2b5r,Thoughts on this High Dividend/Holding Portfolio? (REITS + Strong Dividend Leaders),1538270726.0,19,9,"So Im going to be making an m1 brokerage account (Normal). I opened up a Roth IRA With vanguard and put your usual boring ETF/Index funds stocks that I won't touch till I retire. Also pre-apologies of this being a long post.

HOWEVER, I did want to have something for the intermediate length term that I can watch and learn. I have my Robinhood account I put very little in (were talking like 20 bucks a month) to just play around with. This however is meant to just grow for the intermediate term, aimed at mainly doing dividends with strong companies for the long term. I wanted to have a piece of multiple sectors that I feel are long term plays but I wanted everyone's thoughts **(Suggestions are def. wanted! Im a beginner, this is just my feeling and some basic research i've done so im not claiming anything purely asking advice)**. Also remember this is NOT my roth IRA or 401k. This is something im going to be intermediately funding to learn more about the market and for intermediate to long term growth. I will not be putting all of my money in these or anything.

1. REITS: I do want some of these as they typically pay good dividends and are ""relatively"" stable, however the normal real estate ones don't interest me. This would probably not make up a huge portion of my m1 ""Pie"" but I do like some of these (Besides Reality Income Corp which is boring but strong performance). With interest rates rising I don't see this as a good buy right now....plus I feel like Millennial's probably won't be buying as many houses in the next few years. Just doesn't feel strong.......HOWEVER the following do feel like strong ones:

* Data Center REIT's:  Equinix/DLR and Coresite all seem appealing, I know in 2018 they've hit a dive........but that seems like maybe the best time to buy while they are a little bit low. I know rising interest rates obviously will affect them...but with everything in the world going digital and companies storing more data than ever I see this being strong in the future.  (If you had to pick which ones would you?). I also feel like Iron Mountain fits in here too (as they seem to be a pretty strong dividend wise....but i've heard some shakiness in their long term strategy from doing some research).
* Industrial REIT's: As retail places move more towards online (Amazon/Etc...) this seems like a very strong buy and hold (Good dividends, and I think online stores and shipping are clearly more the norm nowadays). Prologis is the one I know is amazons biggest one, but i'd like to hear of others too.
* Infrastructure REITS: Same reason as above, I only see this industry growing (as it currently is). SBAC and AMT are two that stand out (Although I don't believe SBAC pays out dividends, but it still seems like a strong growth option). I don't know much about the area but i'd like to hear of others.
* Senior Home/Health living facility REITS: SNH and VTR are two high dividend payers that I feel are pretty recession proof...I mean even as medicine advances health care facilities (especially senior health care facilities for all the baby boomers) I see are going to be even a bigger necessity.
* Timberland/Farmland/Specialty: These are specialty ones, I like Gladstone Land(LAND), they've had 2 large farmland acquisitions (I file this under the ""people gotta eat"", plus they are relatively inexpensive). FPI has had some issues it seems. As far as Timber I honestly have zero clue,  Weyerhauser has been mentioned as being pretty strong...but im not knowledgeable about it. It seems like it'd be a solid long holding. However I don't know how in-line Timber is affected by a slowing real estate market (or what I feel is going to be).
* Manufactured Homes/Apartments/Retail/Public Storage: Retail feels like it will be def. on a downturn, Im too uncomfortable about Manufactured Homes to want to invest in their REITS. Apartments ""feel"" like they may become more popular.....but I really have a tough time  knowing what their future is with rising interest rates. Also not knowledgeable enough on public storage (i've heard mixed reviews on their future).

1. Energy/Utilities: I'd like to have some solid high dividend energy stocks. Preferably some in renewable energy as well. However I am completely ignorant about this sector. Dominion and Duke seem popular, No idea on some of the ""Big oil"" companies. I'd like to throw in some in some renewable energy companies (Which Im sure are very low now since Trump doesn't seem to have any interest in them) but it's a matter of time (And might as well buy while they are low)
2. Tech: I feel like there is enough information out there on these and which ones are solid.
3. Bonds: No idea on these??? I think they would be good to have to diversify. I don't think they should make up a significant portion however.
4. Consumer/Industrials: I like Costco/Walmart here, as well as Coke/Pepsi. For Industrials I like UPS (goes along with the ""Shipping everything nowadays"" as well as 3M/Boeing and Waste Management. Also Caterpillar because eventually infrastructure WILL become a problem (it already is) so this seems obvious to stick in.

Sure, they’ll still pay the dividend, but you’ll see your portfolio deflate as well because that $15/share is now $10/share.\n\nThe smarter move I now realize I should have done: buy into dividend focused ETFs. You’ll have higher div yield stocks, which pay a lower net % dividend, but aren’t as vulnerable to pressures that hit REITs. I would have gained value in my portfolio while still earning a decent % dividend. You live and you learn. Stuff like SPYD, SCHD, etc. You can always take a look at what comprises these ETFs and build off their portfolios.\n\nFYI strong, dependable dividend stocks had a difficult 12 months. Basic consumer goods have been flat or marginally down in stock value. However, they still pay dividends. PG, UN, JNJ. Telecoms also pay fat dividends, but they are all saddled with debt.

This is bad, and should serve to decrease how heavily you invest in it.\n\nBonds are inversely correlated with equities and so are useful to diversify.\n\nMy main thought is don't invest in the sector you work in (unless you have highly specific knowledge that leads you to think a company is undervalued and will boom).

I am currently in a target date - Schwab Managed Retirement Trust Fund 2055 - exp ratio 0.69%. Portfolio turnover 4%.

LEG10-25,9pkhbm,History’s Longest Bull Market About to Crash?,1539960354.0,51,0,"  

David Rosenberg thinks this bull market is a sham.

In his [Wednesday interview with CNBC’s “Trading Nation,”](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/23/longest-bull-market-on-record-is-cracking-bear-david-rosenberg-warns.html) he warned that this record-breaking bull market (it’s the longest in history as of August) paired with the weakest economic expansion of all time has only been possible thanks to the flood of cheap money from central banks. 

He’s predicting that first we’ll see pain in the corporate bond market, where rising rates will put severe pressure on a handful of companies that turn out to be the canaries in the coal mine for what’s ahead.

And he’s not alone.

Last month, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Michael Hartnett proclaimed the “Great Bull” market is over – and he also blamed rising rates.

Of course, with a record 3,453 days without a 20% correction, this market can’t keep making history forever. 

We all know there will be a reckoning – but when?

One thing to keep in mind is that staying out of the markets can actually be more expensive than staying in.

Say it’s January 1999 and you have $10,000 to invest.

But it’s a scary time to be pondering an entry into markets. The Dow is up 25% from last year alone. Since three years ago, it’s up an amazing 111%.

So you’re too late, right? Grab a bull by the horns and you’ll end up gored?

Not so simple. From January 1999 to January 2000, the Dow returned another 25%. A simple index fund, even at that late stage of the bull market, would have turned your $10,000 into $12,500.

Of course, a handful of companies did a lot better in the last leg of that bull market.

Just think – from January 1999 – 2000, Qualcomm returned an amazing 2,487%. Even Apple, which was mired in a disastrous turnaround in the late ‘90s, nearly tripled investors’ money from 1999-2000.

If you’d looked at the toppish-seeming markets, and took a pass on putting your $10,000 into them – you could have lost a lot more than $10,000, just by forfeiting potential upside.

Of course, hindsight is 20/20 as the cliché goes.

But the parallels between today’s markets and the Dot.com mania are hard to ignore – both the lessons on risk AND reward. 

And even if you disagree with [this analyst that a stock market “Melt Up” is just beginning to ramp up ](https://orders.stansberryresearch.com/chain?cid=MKT376375&eid=MKT385086&encryptedSnaid=&snaid=&step=start#AST90728) \-- you can’t deny that 2018’s biggest winners so far (tech stocks are leading the charge, with Netflix alone up 68% for the year so far) look a lot like 1999’s tech-heavy list of frontrunners that multiplied investors’ money back then, too.

Again – the bull market has to end. But it doesn’t have to end tomorrow, or even 18 months from now.

And in the meantime, who do you think will look smarter when it’s over? People who got out today… or people who ramped up their tech investments (and keep risk management like trailing stops in mind) – while they ride their winners into the sunset like it’s 1999?

For the past 10 years since 2008, we had breixt selloff, China 2015 Aug meltdown fresh crash, Feb 2018 Vol explosion.... etc. We knew the cause of the selloff almost at the first week when it started. I monitor more than a donze of indicators, even more than half are trending down, but just not enough to trigger selloff like this. Yes we knew Fed's language change, its huge. but the capital is actually pretty confusing. The junk bonds(spreads) are doing bad, but not too bad. Credit market is awful, Bond prices went down together with stocks price. Midterm election/buyback share blackout period? They both start to end or ended in first week in Nov.

Fed and election are not major catalyst for this correction, what is it? I understand there are many bearish data out there, but they are not bad enough to trigger a sellout like hundreds points a day. They are selling on every bounce and rallies.

I believe until we know whats the real reason behind this correction, it will continue regardless of any short term relief.

For all the past correction, we knew when it is about to stop, for example, the expert who trades Vol, they knew when the excessives will sort out and game back to normal.

There’s no precise way to measure the index’s valuation given the issues that money losing companies (\~35% of the index by number and \~25% by market value) present.  
>  
>Bulls touting the 21x PE commit a sin of omission, while bears citing a 62.7x P/E capitalize negative earnings for companies that investors judge worth significant positive values. The following example shows the issue with a simple framework that takes index earnings / index market cap (62.7x). Let’s assume that the index is composed of 2,000 companies, each with a $1bn value.

>Further, let’s assume that 1,999 companies earn $100m and 1 company loses $100bn. The total index earnings would be $100bn for an index P/E of \~20x. However, if we assume that the money losing company has a value of $0, the index P/E would be \~10x. While I’m quick to point out the flaws with the two most common valuation methods, i do not have an obviously better solution. However, through looking at the valuation in a number of ways, I feel comfortable that i’m “approximately right rather than precisely wrong.”

As an aside, the index short eliminates much of the individual security risk. Shorting a speculative biotech may end in disaster but shorting a diversified index of 2,000 companies eliminates the risk that you may misjudge the merits of an individual security. Moreover, it’s difficult to suspend the laws of economics for a large and diversified set of companies. One would expect a set of 2,000 companies to produce average return metrics. The median ROE of profitable companies is 9.7% and the weighted average ROE is 17.4%. Including money losing companies at a -5% ROE (average ROE of money losing companies is actually -85% ROE) reduces the weighted average ROE to 11.8%.  
>  
>The average return on invested capital (NOPAT / common equity plus long-term liabilities) for profitable companies equals 8.8%, with a median of 6.6%. A more generous definition of return on capital (NOPAT / PPE + CA - CL) for profitable companies produces an average and median return of 17.4% and 11.9%, respectively (I round down ROIs >100% to 100% to avoid distorting the averages). Theses returns are based on 2017 earnings relative to 2016/2017 IC.  
>  
>These returns came during a strong economic year and are likely to be lower on a mid/through the cycle basis. Nevertheless, as stated earlier, the returns generated by the R2000 appear to be near or slightly above the cost of capital. This is not a portfolio of 2,000 Amazon’s and Netflix’s, but a diversified collection of average businesses. Even if you believe that we are in the early stages of an economic expansion, the multiples for the group as a whole do not make sense.

>Our case does not rest on margins falling, but I think that the risk is clearly to the downside. Margins have averaged 9.8% over the past 10 years.

Anecdotally, private equity has taken out many of the higher quality, smaller companies, leaving the R2000 with a negative survivor bias. This is difficult to prove, but the pedestrian return on capital metrics show that the index does not deserve a stratospheric multiple

These market cycles have lasted between 21 and 35+ years.

While interest rates are nominal, history shows that earnings of businesses adjust over time to inflation. Therefore, comparing interest rates (nominal) with P/Es or earnings yields (real) is like comparing apples and oranges. Comparing a 10-year treasury yielding 2.9% today vs. 12.4% in December 1980 in the context of stock market valuation or the attractiveness of buying the 10-year treasury is misleading.

>Inflation in 1980 was 13.5% and inflation today is 2.1%. Assuming inflation stayed the same in both periods for the ensuing 10 years, the 2.9% treasury today would actually be the more attractive one in real returns. Its real pre-tax return would be better and real after-tax returns tax would be significantly better than the 1980 bond despite the lower nominal yield.  
>  
>Obviously using current inflation for the next 10 years is a stretch and ideally, we could compare TIPS rates which price in expected inflation, however TIPs were only introduced in 1997. I believe real yields (TIPS) relative to stock earnings yields is not perfect but a better comparison than comparing to nominal yields. Based on this assertion I’m not surprised to find essentially no correlation between nominal interest rates and stock market Schiller P/Es. I would expect a stronger correlation between TIPS rates and P/Es but unfortunately no such data exists. I believe this disproves any logic saying that 3% nominal interest rates justify the current valuations.

**In Conclusion**

I think the valuation of the R2000 index is too high, and it's an interesting topic. But I **dont** have a short position on it, as the idea lacks a good catalyst. Maybe the valuation is too high, it's worth discussing.

However, this is a good example of why you cannot take investment advice from strangers on Reddit. u/Goal1 has yet to defend himself, and deleted his post. I think it's safe to say he misrepresented himself. Stole someone else's work. Was not qualified to defend the work, and essentially was masquerading on r/investing as an expert. I hope no one made any financial decisions based upon his original post.",0.79,"[""The user in question has been banned. Don't plagiarize guys. Reddit is a content aggregator so it's fine to post others work, but don't play it off as your own. Analysts put a fuckload of work into their DD so it really sucks to rip that off for useless karma."", '[deleted]', 'rekt', '[deleted]', 'Haha, brutal.\n\nI’m still interested in discussing the question of valuation, if anyone wants to continue that discussion over here, I’ll post my comment from that thread.\n\n>Alright, lets get substantive with a few random points.\nFirst, its tough to use a lot of your numbers because of your unique manipulations. Without historical data normalized to your rounding and averaging, how is anyone supposed to have a frame of reference for how those numbers compare with... anything? The value in such manipulations seems to me that they can give you insights into the numbers that add up to the index: are the index averages more composed of high-PE companies than they are historically and thus rounding them off causes deviations from the “raw” data? etc. Picking a personal methodology to define valuations and then hoping for a catalyst seems more like... well, just a more complicated way of betting on a catalyst which people have been doing based on “high valuations” for 7+ years already without much luck. Actually, there were potential catalysts that actually occurred, we had government shutdowns and unforced policy errors like near technical defaults and the fiscal cliff that were way more compelling than the ones you list here. What is your rough estimation of the probability that one of these catalysts will actually result in a downturn within the next 12 months?\n\n>Second, margins are not actually mean-reverting. They reflect the business conditions of the time (taxes, inflation, relative market power of firms vs. employees vs. consumers, etc.) and so merely pointing out that margins are currently high does not mean that they must fall. For example, if margins are high due to low taxes and automation which allows companies to suppress wage growth for employees, then none of your catalysts actually push down margins and realistically high margins for the foreseeable future rationally explains high valuations. Similarly, margins in indexes (and economy wide) can be growing because they are being concentrated in specialized firms that monopolize their niche. For example, technology allows a larger share of profits to be earned by companies with strong ecosystems that are not able to be penetrated by competitors merely based on the cost of capital (which is what traditionally limits margins). Facebook isn’t susceptible to “Google+” just because Google can or does invest more in their product, there is a network effect that makes Facebook more valuable just because it is already big. The same goes for Google in the realm of search advertising, they can earn unusual margins in their corner of the market because they aren’t susceptible to “normal” competition even from a well funded and determined competitor like Bing/Microsoft. And the same with Apple, who dominates 85%+ of the mobile phone profit share, and on and on and on. If companies are making unusually high profits in “their niche” and that is the “new normal”, then even when a giant falls, it will be to a company who will come to dominate that niche and earn unusually high profits in its place. This also says nothing about the increasing importance of patents and IP to earnings which are de-facto and sanctioned monopolies expected to earn outsized margins.\n\n>Finally, lets talk about the Schiller PE. Averaging 10 years of earnings is a shot at a dartboard and it basically works on average because there is usually an average of one recession represented in the data. However, because of earnings growth, a recession earlier in that 10 years is less significant, and if you enter a period where no recessions are represented at all then you would obviously expect erroneous readings. This is to say that “Schiller PE is high and likely to go much much higher by 2020 as the last recession rolls off the average” isn’t a statement of valuation, it is a statement of “we haven’t had a recession in 10 years”, so betting against the high Schiller valuations is doing nothing more than just betting on a recession because one is “overdue”. On that score, recoveries from financial crises are always and predictably slow. After the worst recession since the Great Depression, it took us more than 6 years to get back to the previous peak employment. Given that we’ve only had genuine economic expansion for a relatively short time, is “betting on a recession being overdue” really a smart move right now?', 'Well based on an AMA he did, he is a self-proclaimed trashy karmawhore who never posts original content.', 'how do u know he isnt the same person who posted it in value investors club?', ""I give this idiot (well, the original author) two weeks before he's panic covering."", ""Who cares?

Just a note that of the companies below only 1 had an earnings release this week (Walgreens), so that can be struck off as the reason for these stocks' contra-market move.

VTR10-26,9k2b5r,Thoughts on this High Dividend/Holding Portfolio? (REITS + Strong Dividend Leaders),1538270726.0,19,8,"So Im going to be making an m1 brokerage account (Normal). I opened up a Roth IRA With vanguard and put your usual boring ETF/Index funds stocks that I won't touch till I retire. Also pre-apologies of this being a long post.

HOWEVER, I did want to have something for the intermediate length term that I can watch and learn. I have my Robinhood account I put very little in (were talking like 20 bucks a month) to just play around with. This however is meant to just grow for the intermediate term, aimed at mainly doing dividends with strong companies for the long term. I wanted to have a piece of multiple sectors that I feel are long term plays but I wanted everyone's thoughts **(Suggestions are def. wanted! Im a beginner, this is just my feeling and some basic research i've done so im not claiming anything purely asking advice)**. Also remember this is NOT my roth IRA or 401k. This is something im going to be intermediately funding to learn more about the market and for intermediate to long term growth. I will not be putting all of my money in these or anything.

1. REITS: I do want some of these as they typically pay good dividends and are ""relatively"" stable, however the normal real estate ones don't interest me. This would probably not make up a huge portion of my m1 ""Pie"" but I do like some of these (Besides Reality Income Corp which is boring but strong performance). With interest rates rising I don't see this as a good buy right now....plus I feel like Millennial's probably won't be buying as many houses in the next few years. Just doesn't feel strong.......HOWEVER the following do feel like strong ones:

* Data Center REIT's:  Equinix/DLR and Coresite all seem appealing, I know in 2018 they've hit a dive........but that seems like maybe the best time to buy while they are a little bit low. I know rising interest rates obviously will affect them...but with everything in the world going digital and companies storing more data than ever I see this being strong in the future.  (If you had to pick which ones would you?). I also feel like Iron Mountain fits in here too (as they seem to be a pretty strong dividend wise....but i've heard some shakiness in their long term strategy from doing some research).
* Industrial REIT's: As retail places move more towards online (Amazon/Etc...) this seems like a very strong buy and hold (Good dividends, and I think online stores and shipping are clearly more the norm nowadays). Prologis is the one I know is amazons biggest one, but i'd like to hear of others too.
* Infrastructure REITS: Same reason as above, I only see this industry growing (as it currently is). SBAC and AMT are two that stand out (Although I don't believe SBAC pays out dividends, but it still seems like a strong growth option). I don't know much about the area but i'd like to hear of others.
* Senior Home/Health living facility REITS: SNH and VTR are two high dividend payers that I feel are pretty recession proof...I mean even as medicine advances health care facilities (especially senior health care facilities for all the baby boomers) I see are going to be even a bigger necessity.
* Timberland/Farmland/Specialty: These are specialty ones, I like Gladstone Land(LAND), they've had 2 large farmland acquisitions (I file this under the ""people gotta eat"", plus they are relatively inexpensive). FPI has had some issues it seems. As far as Timber I honestly have zero clue,  Weyerhauser has been mentioned as being pretty strong...but im not knowledgeable about it. It seems like it'd be a solid long holding. However I don't know how in-line Timber is affected by a slowing real estate market (or what I feel is going to be).
* Manufactured Homes/Apartments/Retail/Public Storage: Retail feels like it will be def. on a downturn, Im too uncomfortable about Manufactured Homes to want to invest in their REITS. Apartments ""feel"" like they may become more popular.....but I really have a tough time  knowing what their future is with rising interest rates. Also not knowledgeable enough on public storage (i've heard mixed reviews on their future).

1. Energy/Utilities: I'd like to have some solid high dividend energy stocks. Preferably some in renewable energy as well. However I am completely ignorant about this sector. Dominion and Duke seem popular, No idea on some of the ""Big oil"" companies. I'd like to throw in some in some renewable energy companies (Which Im sure are very low now since Trump doesn't seem to have any interest in them) but it's a matter of time (And might as well buy while they are low)

My big mistake. They are hit hard by rising interest rates and hit you again if stock values plunge. Sure, they’ll still pay the dividend, but you’ll see your portfolio deflate as well because that $15/share is now $10/share.\n\nThe smarter move I now realize I should have done: buy into dividend focused ETFs. You’ll have higher div yield stocks, which pay a lower net % dividend, but aren’t as vulnerable to pressures that hit REITs.

1) The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful

2) Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its  always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually  cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months  there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler  data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.  

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom.

edit: I dont understand reddit editing I can't make this easier to read...


The company currently doesn't have positive earnings.  You can see that lately the net income has gone down more and the revenue increased a bit.  The reason for this is that the company has recently shifted to mainly focusing on racing esports.  The companies main source of income in the past has been from running esports events in an arena they rent out in vegas.  They are still doing this today but they made some big changes recently.  The biggest one is buying ownership of EDEN GAMES.  This company develops racing games.  It made Test Drive Unlimited Series and V-Rally Series for playstation.  Now it develops mobile games(Gear.Club and just released F1 mobile Racing today with the company Codemasters).  It also has an exclussive game coming out on the Switch on Dec 4th(Gear.Club unlimited 2).  In acquiring Eden Games the company has said that its future focus will be on growing mobile racing as an esport.  Their game has recently been added to Amazon Go eSport tournaments and they will be using their own arena they have in vegas to run events.

Looking at the stock value.  You can see when it initally went public the volume of trades was very high and the stock raised as high as a dollar before crashing down to .10 where it sits now.  This looks like it was a big pump and dump.  But the stock has been sitting at or close to its current value for a while.

For a company like this it comes down to if you see any value in mobile racing as an esport or as a good way to generate revenue. 
 There last financial report was in May shortly after they aquired Eden Games.  The main source of revenue at this point was from game development and any revenue that gear.club(and old mobile game developed by EDEN games a couple years back).  The next financial will be at the end of the year.  The main source will be from royalties they make from the  F1 Mobile Racing game, gear.club unlimitted 2 being released in Dec, and development for new games coming out in 2019.  The value being so low isn't taking into account the potential future of the company.  So if someone is interested in investing in this company I suggest looking up past racing mobile games to see how popular they were and how much revenue you would expect coming in from games that Millennial Esports will be releasing.  And most of all if you think that racing games have any kind of future in esports.

AMT10-30,9k2b5r,Thoughts on this High Dividend/Holding Portfolio? (REITS + Strong Dividend Leaders),1538270726.0,19,8,"So Im going to be making an m1 brokerage account (Normal). I opened up a Roth IRA With vanguard and put your usual boring ETF/Index funds stocks that I won't touch till I retire. Also pre-apologies of this being a long post.

HOWEVER, I did want to have something for the intermediate length term that I can watch and learn. I have my Robinhood account I put very little in (were talking like 20 bucks a month) to just play around with. This however is meant to just grow for the intermediate term, aimed at mainly doing dividends with strong companies for the long term. I wanted to have a piece of multiple sectors that I feel are long term plays but I wanted everyone's thoughts **(Suggestions are def. wanted! Im a beginner, this is just my feeling and some basic research i've done so im not claiming anything purely asking advice)**. Also remember this is NOT my roth IRA or 401k. This is something im going to be intermediately funding to learn more about the market and for intermediate to long term growth. I will not be putting all of my money in these or anything.

1. REITS: I do want some of these as they typically pay good dividends and are ""relatively"" stable, however the normal real estate ones don't interest me. This would probably not make up a huge portion of my m1 ""Pie"" but I do like some of these (Besides Reality Income Corp which is boring but strong performance). With interest rates rising I don't see this as a good buy right now....plus I feel like Millennial's probably won't be buying as many houses in the next few years. Just doesn't feel strong.......HOWEVER the following do feel like strong ones:

* Data Center REIT's:  Equinix/DLR and Coresite all seem appealing, I know in 2018 they've hit a dive........but that seems like maybe the best time to buy while they are a little bit low. I know rising interest rates obviously will affect them...but with everything in the world going digital and companies storing more data than ever I see this being strong in the future.  (If you had to pick which ones would you?). I also feel like Iron Mountain fits in here too (as they seem to be a pretty strong dividend wise....but i've heard some shakiness in their long term strategy from doing some research).
* Industrial REIT's: As retail places move more towards online (Amazon/Etc...) this seems like a very strong buy and hold (Good dividends, and I think online stores and shipping are clearly more the norm nowadays). Prologis is the one I know is amazons biggest one, but i'd like to hear of others too.
* Infrastructure REITS: Same reason as above, I only see this industry growing (as it currently is). SBAC and AMT are two that stand out (Although I don't believe SBAC pays out dividends, but it still seems like a strong growth option). I don't know much about the area but i'd like to hear of others.
* Senior Home/Health living facility REITS: SNH and VTR are two high dividend payers that I feel are pretty recession proof...I mean even as medicine advances health care facilities (especially senior health care facilities for all the baby boomers) I see are going to be even a bigger necessity.
* Timberland/Farmland/Specialty: These are specialty ones, I like Gladstone Land(LAND), they've had 2 large farmland acquisitions (I file this under the ""people gotta eat"", plus they are relatively inexpensive). FPI has had some issues it seems. As far as Timber I honestly have zero clue,  Weyerhauser has been mentioned as being pretty strong...but im not knowledgeable about it. It seems like it'd be a solid long holding. However I don't know how in-line Timber is affected by a slowing real estate market (or what I feel is going to be).
* Manufactured Homes/Apartments/Retail/Public Storage: Retail feels like it will be def. on a downturn, Im too uncomfortable about Manufactured Homes to want to invest in their REITS. Apartments ""feel"" like they may become more popular.....but I really have a tough time  knowing what their future is with rising interest rates. Also not knowledgeable enough on public storage (i've heard mixed reviews on their future).

1. Energy/Utilities: I'd like to have some solid high dividend energy stocks. Preferably some in renewable energy as well. However I am completely ignorant about this sector. Dominion and Duke seem popular, No idea on some of the ""Big oil"" companies. I'd like to throw in some in some renewable energy companies (Which Im sure are very low now since Trump doesn't seem to have any interest in them) but it's a matter of time (And might as well buy while they are low)
2. Tech: I feel like there is enough information out there on these and which ones are solid.
3. Bonds: No idea on these??? I think they would be good to have to diversify. I don't think they should make up a significant portion however.
4. Consumer/Industrials: I like Costco/Walmart here, as well as Coke/Pepsi. For Industrials I like UPS (goes along with the ""Shipping everything nowadays"" as well as 3M/Boeing and Waste Management. Also Caterpillar because eventually infrastructure WILL become a problem (it already is) so this seems obvious to stick in.
5. Other Suggestions: This is where you come in :) (Obviously i'd be pulling some from the Aristocrats).",0.75,"['Another sector could be Financials. I’ll admit I don’t understand technology at all, but I do like PRMTX, which has beaten the SP the past 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. Oil, personally, I like the companies that didn’t cut their dividend a few years back during the down turn of oil. Your overall portfolio is pretty good! \n\nIt’s good to have some money in bonds. Subtract your age from 110 to know how much to have in stocks vs bonds. \n', ""What about MLPs??? I have heard they don't get taxed at least the dividend does not... buy requires a special tax form at year end"", 'Here is something that I saved from another user .....Nope, whether you pay tax on the dividend depends on the classification of dividend.\n\nThere are several types:\n\n•\t\u2060""qualified dividend"" - these usually come from regular C-corps like AT&T or Microsoft, you pay long term capital gains rate\n•\t\u2060""unqualified dividend"" - you pay the short term capital gains rate, which is same as your income tax bracket rate\n•\t\u2060""return of capital"" - you pay ZERO tax on these\n\nREIT dividends are nearly entirely ""unqualified dividends"", which are always taxed at your income tax bracket rate, some REIT do have a small portion of ""return of capital"", it\'s rare for a REIT to have a large return of capital dividend, unless perhaps they just sold large amount of assets.\n\nMLP dividends are nearly entirely ""return of capital"", which is the key advantage of the MLP structure, you pay 0 tax on these, but they reduce your cost basis, and you pay long term capital gains tax when you sell.', 'I held REITs when I first started. My big mistake. They are hit hard by rising interest rates and hit you again if stock values plunge. Sure, they’ll still pay the dividend, but you’ll see your portfolio deflate as well because that $15/share is now $10/share.\n\nThe smarter move I now realize I should have done: buy into dividend focused ETFs. You’ll have higher div yield stocks, which pay a lower net % dividend, but aren’t as vulnerable to pressures that hit REITs. I would have gained value in my portfolio while still earning a decent % dividend. You live and you learn. Stuff like SPYD, SCHD, etc. You can always take a look at what comprises these ETFs and build off their portfolios.\n\nFYI strong, dependable dividend stocks had a difficult 12 months. Basic consumer goods have been flat or marginally down in stock value. However, they still pay dividends. PG, UN, JNJ. Telecoms also pay fat dividends, but they are all saddled with debt. T, VZ in particular. Financials aren’t bad either. May be helpful to look at a financials ETF to compliment the dividend focused ETF.', ""Energy is not going anywhere. Current oil companies will shift to other energy sources as oil becomes less economical.\n\nTech is volatile. It is boom and bust. This is bad, and should serve to decrease how heavily you invest in it.\n\nBonds are inversely correlated with equities and so are useful to diversify.\n\nMy main thought is don't invest in the sector you work in (unless you have highly specific knowledge that leads you to think a company is undervalued and will boom). Don't invest in tech if you work in it. It will eventually bust and your funds will dip when you are out of a job and need them most."", '[removed]', ""There's nothing wrong with some REITs in a Roth IRA.   In a regular investment account, however, it's not as good due to the dividends always being taxed at your top rate.""]"

IPGP10-30,9ldc7a,I Have Sold All My Chinese Stocks... Here's Why,1538669780.0,5,0,"This morning, I sold the three Chinese stocks I owned (BIDU, BZUN and IQ). They represented 6.5% of my investment portfolio. (I decided to hold IPGP, a western company that derives a substantial share of its business in China.)

I have long had mixed feelings about Chinese stocks. Of course, China is a huge market and many of their companies are still in their ""baby"" stages. On the face of it, a superb opportunity. However, China regulation is lax and corruption rampant. It is not uncommon for board members, executives or external organizations to remove substantial investor owned assets without full disclosure or explanation. I also see frequent spin-offs of IPOs that seem to be more about capturing western dollars than making any strategic sense (e.g., if BIDU is such a great company and doing so well, why did they spin-off IQ rather than keep it and conquer the world?).

The last straw was [this article in today's New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/business/china-economy-private-enterprise.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fbusiness&action=click&contentCollection=business&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=6&pgtype=sectionfront). The NYT reports that voices advocating the government take over private businesses are growing louder and more common. I don't think China will ever go back to 100% government controlled economy, but I wouldn't be surprised if they retreat substantially from their current 90% private/10% government economy. 

Western investors are the last people that the Chinese government cares about. We are already being cheated, I think the signs are that the cheating is only going to increase. I'm out.

FLIR10-30,9ncgbw,Investing while Supporting Climate Change Mitigation/Reversal,1539281963.0,16,6,"I'm curious if there are any other investors out there who are taking climate change and reports like this ([https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html)) to heart when deciding on their investments, and if anyone has any strategies besides investing in ESG ETFs for putting their money where their mouth is?

&#x200B;

While I understand that generally profit and capitalism goes against the general principles of environmentalism, I also believe that few people will invest their money in environmental efforts without some sort of financial incentive. While reading \[Drawdown\]([https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank)), I realize that we will need to fund businesses with practices that will help us gather data around climate change or actually aid in drawing-down carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

Here are some stocks I've picked and the reasoning behind them (including future-potential, financial and environmental reasons):

&#x200B;

IBM

\- owns the Weather Company and is invested in providing climate and weather-based business analytics, this type of analytics will be essential for the viability of the global economy as shifts in climate occur (I think most people can agree upon this, regardless if you believe that climate change is human-caused or that reversal is possible)

\- high dividend yield (3.85)

\- just went through a major restructuring for the future

\- 25 years of patent leadership ([https://www.research.ibm.com/patents/](https://www.research.ibm.com/patents/))

\- invested in AI (Watson) and Quantum Computing

\- analysts say IBM is set-up for a correction

\- fiscally conservative, more responsible tech company that's lasted through multiple burst tech bubbles and has been around longer than practically any other tech company

\- main climate cause: **climate data**

&#x200B;

PEGI - Pattern Energy Group

\- independent energy group which owns and operates wind and solar power facilities sales contracts

\- operates across US, Canada, and Chile

\- headquartered in San Francisco, CA - large talent pool

\- high dividend yield (7.79)

\- positive outlook by analysts

\- main climate cause: **solar/wind**

&#x200B;

TPIC - TPI Composites

\- holding company that engages in the manufacture of wind blades for the wind energy market

\- 2016 IPO with positive outlook by analysts (grew 118.93% since IPO, 9.37% in past year)

\- positive earnings in the past year, but no dividend yet

\- founded in 1968 - one of the oldest wind blade manufacturers in the world - tons of experience in the space

\- main climate cause: **wind**

&#x200B;

TDOC - Teladoc Health

\- Telecommunication healthcare services prevents people from having to drive to a hospital and doctors from having to travel to a health facility, thus besides being a great way to curb emissions, it also will save the economy large amounts of money in travel and wait time to go see physicians.

\- incredibly positive outlook by analysts (grew 98.32% in the past year)

\- main climate cause: **reduce transportation emissions**

&#x200B;

FLIR

\- *FLIR* Systems is the world's largest commercial company specializing in the design and production of thermal imaging cameras

\- positive earnings and high dividend yield (1.29)

\- thermal imaging is a data sensor technology that has not been fully realized in modern day life, but has many positive uses across safety, health, art, crime prevention, etc.

\- thermal imaging will be incredibly important for improving heating and cooling of any facility, and this will become even more important as temperatures become more extreme and we need to conserve more energy and consume less fossil fuels

\- only main risk I can see is if the large phone companies like Apple and Google start integrating thermal cameras directly into their devices (which they should)

\- main climate cause - **refrigeration**

&#x200B;

ADSK & NVIDIA

\- Not going to get too much into detail about them, but largely I think both companies will be huge in their ability to continue to provide tools (such as CAD and AI) that will help us develop even better solutions to tomorrows problems. These companies also largely don't have companies that can directly compete with them on different levels (with the exception of AMD maybe in NVIDIA's case)

&#x200B;

I have also been looking to other investment strategies like \[WunderCapital\]([https://www.wundercapital.com/](https://www.wundercapital.com/)), but alas this is not an option for a non-accredited investor.

**Please feel free to share other stocks you have invested in for similar reasons and/or other similar investment opportunities you have explored.**

P.S. Also, before anyone says I am wholly optimistic, I do indeed have investments in ETFs and stocks in other companies and industries. This post is purely to promote positive conversation and debate in the ESG pro-climate investment space.

All that needs to be done is identify public companies with major product lines enjoyed particularly by basic white girls and equal weight them.

* AAPL

* DECK

* DIS

* EL

* NKE

* SBUX

If we add foreign stocks, we can include these:

* DEO

* LRLCY

* LVMUY

I don't remember the rest of what we came up with, but regardless, backtest and behold. White girls crush the market.

EDIT: I'm back in this thread, and I agree about several of the proposed additions, most notably TIF. A lot of you are asking why I left out SNAP, though. I simply forgot about it, but even if I didn't, it's been public for such a short time that it would screw up any decent backtest, and I would probably not include a company with no history of positive EPS anyways. That said, if any of you put some money into a scheme like this, feel free to add or subtract whatever you want. I am powerless to stop you.

EDIT2: In accordance with community consensus, we can go ahead and add these:

I am considering investing in an annuity. It seems like another tool in my toolbox of financial independent. I am in my 30s, self-employed. I have 2 questions regarding annuities.

Just ride it out!', 'When I left the industry, ""conventional wisdom"" was that there was a -window- of assets for which an annuity would be recommended.  Remember that an annuity is an insurance product; you\'re paying someone to manage some money and -guarantee- that it will be there when you need it.  (The guarantee is what you\'re paying for.)\n\n* If you didn\'t have much to start with, there wasn\'t much to be gained by insuring it -- below a certain threshhold, no annuity.\n* Above a certain level, you don\'t need the guarantee --  you can probably ""ride out"" any market fluctuations.\n* In between, there is value in insuring a part of your retirement income.  Not all of it.\n\nMy opinion is that you don\'t need an annuity YET -- too soon. \n\nCheck the insurance company ratings sites -- A. M. Best is a name that comes to mind.  You want to see who\'s financially stable, who has a good claims-paying history, etc . . . and who\'s going to be around to pay out the money when the time comes.  We sold from only two or three companies, for example.\n', 'I ended up at an entirely (or the most part) different place. I use annuities as a supplementary(see PS) tax-deferred investment. Both Vanguard an Fidelity offer annuities with lower M&E costs, in exchange for NO downside protection or income guarantees. Its the riders that are expensive not necessarily the annuities themselves. \n\nPS: This only makes sense if you have already exhausted your other avenues for tax-deferred investment.', 'I would caution you about indexed annuities. The downside protection is prominently mentioned but that is usually traded for a cap on the upside as well. Stock indices have up and down years but tend to have more of the good ones than the bad, and giving up the downside usually means giving up the downside as well through a combination of caps on the gains and participation rates. A good alternative would be just investing in a mix of stocks and bonds and use asset allocation to increase or decrease the amount of risk you would face from a market downturn. Also, if an indexed annuity claims not to have fees, than that usually means the fees are baked into the caps and participation rate.\n\nThe deferred income annuities can often be great additions and getting a policy that begins paying you when you are older (around 80 years old) can often provide you with all the income you need for a low cost. This also means that when planning for retirement, you do not need your assets to last indefinitely, but only until the annuity pays out.\n\n', 'I am a wholesaler in the annuity field. I will agree they are expensive. But they are expensive for a good reason. Because no other investment product can offer a guarantee. \n\nA FIA (fixed indexed annuity) can be a great alternative to a bond/CD as it has principal protection, upside potential, and no fees. \n\nI have to ask, why are you looking at annuities in your 30s? Are you worried about a correction? ']"

&#x200B;

There's a section bout ""pre-mixed diversified funds"" and I guess I should say ""2060 Retirement Date Fund"" and/or the ""Aggressive Risk Fund?"" I have no idea about the the portfolio building block section, which includes U.S. Equity, Non-U.S. Equity, Fixed Income, and Non-Traditional Diversifying funds (and each of these has several subsections like ""large cap,"" ""stable asset,"" and ""alternative alpha""). Finally, there's a section called ""self-directed brokerage."" Huh?

I don't now if this helps, but the funds will be managed by the ABA Retirement Funds Program. I intend to call them on Monday but hope to know at least a little before then.

Do you know what these things mean? And do you have suggestions for strategies?

&#x200B;

**Background**: 

I'm 26, make $23 per hour, and work 40 hours a week.

After a year of employment I'm eligible to enroll in my firm's 401(k) plan. My employer will match my contribution up to 4% with the contingency I contribute at least 5% of my salary. I intend to take advantage of this matched contribution.

We don't have an HR department with whom I can discuss this. We're a very small team and I'll be the first person to take advantage of my employer's contribution.

Around 40 switch to safer bets that have less growth."", ""I agree with the previous post that you should start out by putting it into the target date fund, then do some research to determine if that's the best option or you. Target date funds aren't always the best, but they're better than throwing your money into indexes you know nothing about. \n\nThe target date fund will be a medium-risk mix of domestic and international stocks, with maybe ~5% bonds. The level of risk will decrease the closer you get to the target date. The aggressive risk fund will allocate more money towards growth and value stocks, and probably 0% bonds, which isn't a bad thing for someone your age. Self-directed brokerage means that you're going to manage everything yourself, and choose what stocks, ETFs, bonds, etc, you want in your portfolio. I'd argue that for a 'set it and forget it' investment like a 401k, there's really no need to go that route. For most people at least.\n\nYou also probably have the option of allocating a certain percentage towards different funds, for instance 70% target date and 30% aggresive, but for now just do the target date until you feel more familiar with everything. \n\nFor what it's worth, I did something similar to the 70/30 for my 401k, and I have a Roth that I use for picking and choosing individual stocks and indexes."", 'Your enrollment form should have come with some sort of magazine or brochure type informational.

In most plans that is an S&P500 index fund.

It may be the best choice for well paid top management (if that company has such) because the effective cost of those fees is reduced both by having a larger contribution per year and expecting to stay with the company for decades rather than just years.

TEL10-31,9mg4xx,Understanding Key Executive Relationships between Companies,1539014488.0,2,3,"Let me know if this is not the right place to post this and I'll move it! I just thought this group of people might be able to help me understand this issue further:

I am looking into a small cable company, Cable One (NYSE: CABO). They provide cable services in rural America.

They recently replaced their CFO with a guy named Steven Scott Cochran. *Note: if you google him, he is not the Steven Scott Cochran who happens to be the same age and is currently serving jail time for robbing a woman at gunpoint. At least, not to my knowledge.*

Anyways, Cochran came to Cable One from a competing company, WideOpenWest (NYSE:WOW) where he was CEO.

Cochran still holds about $6MM worth of WOW stock and (from what I can tell) is still serving as the CEO of WideOpenWest's subsidiary, WideOpenWest Networks. He is also serving as President at Sigecom, another subsidiary of WOW. Lastly, Cochran is serves as CEO at another competing company, IpTel Direct.

CableOne, WideOpenWest, and IpTel Direct all compete with each other. IpTel Direct isn't publicly traded, however, CableOne and WOW each recognize each other as competitors in their annual reports. My first instinct was that IpTel was a subsidiary of WOW, however, I can't find any information on them at all beyond my terminal. Even their website says the IP address can't be found. To make things worse, the registered address of IpTel is one of those rent-an-address ""virtual"" locations, so it's not even a real office.

So I felt a little weird about this. Firstly, because it seems that Cochran is going to be really busy holding all of those roles. And secondly because of the inherent conflict of interest from serving in all of these positions.

I've never seen such strong competitor overlap before and I'm not quite sure what to make of it. Is this type of overlap typical amongst smaller companies in niche industries? If it is, how do you get comfortable investing with an executive serving in two roles (or more)? Could it be an indicator of a potential merger between CableOne and WOW? Alternatively, is this just raising enough red flags to land a plane?

&#x200B;

**Bonus:**

There's lot of other overlap between executives too, which makes me think this is more common than I expected-

WOW CFO Rich Fish (best name ever) also serves as CFO for IpTel and ICG Telecom, both of which are WOW competitors.

Catherin Kuo, IpTel's COO is also the head of marketing at Sigecom and is a ""senior key executive"" at WOW.

Cash Hagen, IpTel's CTO is also the COO at WideOpenWest Network (not the parent company, the subsidiary that Cochran also works for)

Donald Martin is the Chief Legal Officer for IpTel and WOW (and WOW subsidiaries)

&#x200B;

**Extra Bonus:** 

I am using the CapIQ terminal, in case anyone is curious. The phone number listed for IpTel Direct is the same phone number listed for all the key executives, including Cochran, above. The phone number is a Geeker support phone number. When I called they said they have no clue who/what IpTel Direct was and that they were a call center.

The team is a super group, they see an opportunity and go in to transform it and sell it quickly (1-3 years).\n\n2. They\'re looking to buy and finalize the transaction, within 4-5 months usually goes private. \n\n\nThese two scenarios are fairly similar in operation, slightly different time frames.\n\n  \n\n\nPandora (P) is a perfect recent example by the way.

But they usually join crappy companies. This doesn\'t seem like that.\n\n  \n\n\n4. CEO moves, gets their bearings, and within a year or two brings over the CFO and board owing to an ""aha"" moment.\n\n  \n\n\nThats the main ones I\'ve seen.

Hoping someone could give me some advice, there has been lots of other discussions about this but no straight answer.

I currently trade every day and do most of my charting using tradingview however it is limited as there are certain things that it just doesn't do compared to charting software.

The software that would seem to do everything I need is Thinkorswim but you can't have it in the uk !

Main things I want is a ability to link multiple graphs with decent forex / stock live listings that you can click on and all the linked graphs change at once which you can do with thinkorswim.

&#x200B;

I don't need a broker platform, I just need decent charting designed for traders.  Someone suggested Ninjatrade but that only works with Windows and I'm a Mac user !

Any thoughts comments or help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers

ICE10-31,9n3h8h,What is the rationale behind short selling's legality? Does it provide any value to the economy? Does that matter?,1539205233.0,10,6,"Sorry if this comes off as a soapbox speech. I actually don't have an opinion on short selling one way or the other because I don't think I know enough about it to have an opinion. It just sounds difficult to justify to this layman, so I'm trying to learn a little more. 

This question was prompted mainly by the statements made by the enchanting Musk wafting in from Twitter lately. I don't have any skin in this anymore. I sold my Tesla stock shortly after the Joe Rogan Show debacle. I have zero qualms with people smoking pot. I don't even care if they do it in public. What I do have a problem with, though, is a man who is the public face of a company by default showing little to no regard for how his actions might be perceived by the public and affect said company. As a CEO, I wouldn't go light up a blunt during a public podcast for the same reason I wouldn't get fall down drunk and stumble into an interview on Oprah. He'd been on my shit list since the cave thing, but that pod was the final proof I needed that he's definitely not an eccentric genius so much as a hardworking rich kid, plagued by many of the classic rich kid ego and maturity issues, who happened to be in the right place at the right time with the right funding for Paypal to work and now has too much money/power to ever really grow up or be told his ideas suck by anyone close to him. That's not someone you want running your company.

All that said, his statement claiming that short sellers are value destroyers and it should be illegal did get me thinking. Why *is* short selling legal? What exactly *is* the rationale for it? Is there one? Does it arguably provide some kind of value to the market or is it more just America's distaste for regulation? For an amateur like me, it does seem kind of crazy that all these people have invested billions in failure. Think about it on a smaller scale. Imagine if you could literally buy an interest in the failure of the ice cream shop down the street? Or better yet, how about if you could take an interest in the personal failure of your neighbor in his career? How could that possibly be a good thing? They're literally investing in the breakdown of the basic fabric of a capitalist democracy. Businesses going out of business is generally bad for a country. In fact, this nation bends over backwards to try to get people to start innovative small businesses that we hope will blossom into something like Tesla. The way some politicians talk I sometimes feel like I should be thanking small business owners for their service. 

It also seems like short selling is a bit of self-fulfilling prophecy in the sense that if enough people want something to fail it will drag it down enough that it will, which is a dangerous concept that seems like it could spread like a cancer around the economy. It amplifies negative news and seemingly makes the success of a business a damned if you do, damned if you don't proposition for the economy as a whole since no matter what happens someone is going to lose a lot of money. 

But I also know enough to know I have no idea what I'm talking about, so could someone please explain to me what short sellers contribute to the world? Are they like a forest fire speeding up the removal of old brush and decay? That's really the only rationale I could think of and it's not particularly convincing.

If a housing bubble existing in the USA collapsed international markets in 2008, would a housing bubble occurring in Asia, Australia, Europe and New Zealand collapse international markets in the near future? 

Why do I ask?

When I visited China last month, I learned that an apartment in Beijing and Shanghai costs $10,000 USD per sq. ft. Yeah, whoah! Not only this, but the inflation rate is so high that investing in real estate wouldn't have paid off. Would be nice to have someone validate this. 

When in Qingdao, I witnessed a decades worth of infrastructure and I can't put this observation into words.... 11km tunnel, 15 mile bridge and modern buildings 25 times the size of Hartford constructed within 10 years to accommodate a population that significantly overpowers US residents.

If a housing bubble exists in asian markets and the system collapses...will this will have greater impact on international trade (especially on the US market) at a time when interest rates are rising and trade wars are developing. 

My wife, who is Kiwi, has seen her family home increase 10x in the last decade.

There are factors in the housing situation in the USA that explain the lack of significant increase in housing. For instance, the amount of student debt many in the USA carry is extremely high. This causes many younger consumers to avoid taking on more debt in the form of a mortgage. There are many signs that, while the economy as a whole seems to have recovered, the average American has not seen a significant improvement in their financial situation from between the aftermath of the recession and today.

For example, Turkey is far more significant because some European banks hold pretty sizeable exposures there.\n\nHowever, two side points: One, Chinese citizens have begun trying to take their money out of China. Because China's financial system is closed, banks don't have to pay market interest, and this leads to money either going into property (it is also why China has so many investment scams) or trying to leave the country. It has gone into places like Australia, NZ, and Canada (and other places). This has driven up housing prices, which has driven up household debt, and no-one really knows how it will end. \n\nFor reference: US household debt to GDP topped out at ~100% in 2007 and is now slightly under 80%. Canada's household debt to GDP is ~100%, Australia is 120%, and New Zealand is 92%. Also, in all of these countries, afaik, there are a small number of very big banks. This makes resolving a crisis easier, potentially, but it will also likely mean that the cost will be very large. There is no way that housing prices can ever be allowed to fall (the consequences of inter-generational wealth transfer here are huge...if your parents don't own property in these countries, you will be likely be poor when you die and so will your children). This isn't all China's fault, there are few linkages outside of the regions concerned afaik but it will be pretty ugly all the same (I am guessing all of these nations have a crisis and then slowly stagnate under the weight of their debt, as in the UK).\n\nTwo, China's financial system is closed but it is obviously a huge part of global trade. I don't think anyone really understands how this will work out tbh. I think the general consensus is that China has moved to a more sensible international position overall as their trade surplus is down significantly. Contrast this with Germany, a trade surplus over 8%, heavily integrated into a lot of major product markets, and likely exporting substantial amounts of deflation (Italy, Netherlands similar). And whilst China has operated in relatively good faith when it came to trade, Germany has not and has always stridently denied any responsibility (and has always done so historically too, afaik). In terms of trade, Germany/the EU is a far bigger problem than China.""]"

SBUX11-01,9o5nfh,30 stocks that bucked the index last week,1539545963.0,12,42,"weeks like the one we just had are rare and in such times I like looking at the companies that went the other way. Mostly to see why they did what they did. In that analysis lies (I believe) valuable information about investor behaviour, preferences and latent value to be captured. If nothing else, I believe the companies below and the sectors/industries to which they are assigned represent the answer to what is often asked on these board, i.e. ""Which stocks/sectors/industries do better than the market in a bear market or recession?""

Looking just at the sp500, there were 30 companies which closed on Friday, at a higher price than their price on Monday. Enjoy your analysis of the below. Just a note that of the companies below only 1 had an earnings release this week (Walgreens), so that can be struck off as the reason for these stocks' contra-market move.

SBUX11-01,9tijn5,My best and worst trades - Week ending October 2 2018,1541151564.0,5,4,"Hey guys, I am going to start making these posts as a way to keep track of my trades, as well as to hopefully get some insight from the industry professionals here. I am a college student that is mainly trading options based off of my earnings forecasts, as well as some on credit ETFs and country specific ETFs.

&#x200B;

# Best performing trades this week

&#x200B;

# SBUX

* I was anticipating higher earnings growth for their stores in China
* I had a foretasted EPS of .64 cents a share, mainly contingent on the increased growth in their China stores, but also because of the decreased price of coffee commodities
* I bought the 62 / 62.5 debit call spread for .07 ($7) per spread expiring Friday at  midday yesterday
* They beat average earnings estimate at .62 cents per share announced post market yesterday
* Provided they open today at their postmarket price yesterday or higher of I will make 0.5 ($50) per spread
* Approximate profit : 714%

# RHT

* Legged into a trade based on pricing disparity in the weeklies following the IBM Acquisition announcement
* Bought the 180 call for 0.25
* Sold the 182.5 call for 0.30 15 minutes later
* Approximate profit: 20%

# TLT / FLRN / GSY

* This is more of a practice in portfolio ideation and management, I have a separate account from my options trading for  managing this
* Long bond ETFs decay uniquely during a rising rate environment due to the high portfolio turnover created by the Creation / Redemption unit process that is used to track the underlying. Turnover is often in excess of 100% per month. 
* Short sold TLT (20+ year treasury ETF), used cash to purchase FLRN (Float rate corporate ETF)
* Created a synthetic bond spread, as equity markets rally / interest rates rise the spread widens
* Because my net effect on cash was 0 I bought GSY to yield on the remaining cash. I am maintaining cash in the account for re-balancing weekly
* October 2018 returns: 1.65%

# 

# Worst performing trades this week

&#x200B;

# EWA

* I have been anticipating significant financial turmoil in the Australian housing market
* Majority of households are over-levered on adjustable rate debt
* Their housing situation is like 2008 on steroids, negative gearing and bad lending practices have led to a housing bubble
* The question remains as to derivatives exposure of the Australian Financials
* Bought the April 2019 18 put for 0.25 at the beginning of October
* Last week sold the April 2019 16 put for 0.25
* Cost of the trade is now 0.00, but Australian central bankers seem determined that they can sustain lower rates indefinitely so I do not anticipate a short term profit
* I anticipate having to roll the trade at beginning of Q1 next year when new options series begin trading

# EWI

* I have been bearish on Italy for months, their credit situation is a night mare, looking like a repeat of the cypress fiasco potentially
* Moody's rating of BBB for the country's credit is absurd, but well timed on their part amid demands from the Bundesbank
* Italy needs to devalue their currency and cannot due to being on the Euro
* I am the 20/19 debit put spread but am anticipating closing the trade at a loss",0.59,"['Well thought post. Please continue posting stuff like this! 👍', 'Use a spreadsheet. No one here cares. ']"

PPL11-01,9rnngz,"Understanding the SEMI cycle.MU, NVDA, AMD, TXN, $SOX",1540580891.0,14,13,"I though I would write a short post for some of the youngins here who have never experienced a real correction or know what a market cycle is. 

1) The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful

2) Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its  always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually  cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months  there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler  data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.  

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom. 

Happy trading

&#x200B;",0.75,"[""In regards to memory and MU in general... Maybe you missed the SK Hynix CC this week. Let me fill you in some, because there is alot of misconception with Micron and it is trading based off of pure fear. SK Hynix said on the call the expect DRAM price INCREASES to be weaker over the next 2 Qs. Most likely ASP increases of 0-1%. They also said the feel prices might start to move back up in 2H '19 due to large demand increases. So what is going on here? Is there actually a demand problem as you say? Seems the opposite from their call. The media/analysts running around with their heads cut off screaming the end of the world for memory/semis. The DRAM industry is an Oligopoly now. Totally controlled by 3 compaines that will have 100% incentive to not over produce like old times. Good luck, stay up to date with SK Hynix/Samsung calls"", '[deleted]', 'What you’re missing is that prices for memory always go down on a long term scale. But what also goes is cost of production. Micron and others are expecting about 20-30% reduction in cost, which could offset most or even all of the pricing decline. ']"

However, there is a major issue here, we don't know whats really behind this selloff. For the past 10 years since 2008, we had breixt selloff, China 2015 Aug meltdown fresh crash, Feb 2018 Vol explosion.... etc. We knew the cause of the selloff almost at the first week when it started. I monitor more than a donze of indicators, even more than half are trending down, but just not enough to trigger selloff like this. Yes we knew Fed's language change, its huge. but the capital is actually pretty confusing. The junk bonds(spreads) are doing bad, but not too bad. Credit market is awful, Bond prices went down together with stocks price. Midterm election/buyback share blackout period? They both start to end or ended in first week in Nov. Why ppl are dumping shares so bad when they knew the market is coming back up right afterward. It doesnt make sense. I don't want to talk about the data or TA here to debate with you guys. None of MSM or experts are clear define why this is happening. This is bad news. The correction have started a few weeks we know nothing yet. Fed and election are not major catalyst for this correction, what is it? I understand there are many bearish data out there, but they are not bad enough to trigger a sellout like hundreds points a day. They are selling on every bounce and rallies.

I believe until we know whats the real reason behind this correction, it will continue regardless of any short term relief.

For all the past correction, we knew when it is about to stop, for example, the expert who trades Vol, they knew when the excessives will sort out and game back to normal. I found nothing in the media or from the experts, even the bearish, doom experts dont have anything can convince me, they just repeat what they have saying.

>**Valuation**

>Analysts most often use P/E ratios to measure the R2000’s valuation. The Russell 2000 is often quoted as P/E excluding negative earnings for which it sports a 21x P/E ratio. If we are to include companies that lose money, the P/E increases to 62.7x. There’s no precise way to measure the index’s valuation given the issues that money losing companies (\~35% of the index by number and \~25% by market value) present.  
>  
>Bulls touting the 21x PE commit a sin of omission, while bears citing a 62.7x P/E capitalize negative earnings for companies that investors judge worth significant positive values. The following example shows the issue with a simple framework that takes index earnings / index market cap (62.7x). Let’s assume that the index is composed of 2,000 companies, each with a $1bn value.  
>  
>Further, let’s assume that 1,999 companies earn $100m and 1 company loses $100bn. The total index earnings would be $100bn for an index P/E of \~20x. However, if we assume that the money losing company has a value of $0, the index P/E would be \~10x. While I’m quick to point out the flaws with the two most common valuation methods, i do not have an obviously better solution. However, through looking at the valuation in a number of ways, I feel comfortable that i’m “approximately right rather than precisely wrong.”

>**Return on Capital and Margins**  
>  
>Stocks should trade at high multiples when margins are set to rise or the business can grow at returns on capital above the cost of capital. As an aside, the index short eliminates much of the individual security risk. Shorting a speculative biotech may end in disaster but shorting a diversified index of 2,000 companies eliminates the risk that you may misjudge the merits of an individual security. Moreover, it’s difficult to suspend the laws of economics for a large and diversified set of companies. One would expect a set of 2,000 companies to produce average return metrics. The median ROE of profitable companies is 9.7% and the weighted average ROE is 17.4%. Including money losing companies at a -5% ROE (average ROE of money losing companies is actually -85% ROE) reduces the weighted average ROE to 11.8%.  
>  
>The average return on invested capital (NOPAT / common equity plus long-term liabilities) for profitable companies equals 8.8%, with a median of 6.6%. A more generous definition of return on capital (NOPAT / PPE + CA - CL) for profitable companies produces an average and median return of 17.4% and 11.9%, respectively (I round down ROIs >100% to 100% to avoid distorting the averages). Theses returns are based on 2017 earnings relative to 2016/2017 IC.  
>  
>These returns came during a strong economic year and are likely to be lower on a mid/through the cycle basis. Nevertheless, as stated earlier, the returns generated by the R2000 appear to be near or slightly above the cost of capital. This is not a portfolio of 2,000 Amazon’s and Netflix’s, but a diversified collection of average businesses. Even if you believe that we are in the early stages of an economic expansion, the multiples for the group as a whole do not make sense.  
>  
>With respect to margins, we can assume that the Russell 2000’s margins are correlated with the Fed’s corporate margin data. The Fed’s data set dates back to 1947 and shows a clear mean reverting trend. The average margin over this period is 6.9% compared to today at 9.5% (86.6% percentile).  
>  
>Our case does not rest on margins falling, but I think that the risk is clearly to the downside. Margins have averaged 9.8% over the past 10 years. This ranks in the 96.7% percentile for 10-year periods. If margins were to fall to historical averages, the Schiller P/E would rise from 32.8x to 48.5x.  
>  
>Moreover, we hear that margins should be higher today given the shift towards capital light companies in the index. However, to produce a similar return on capital, economic theory suggests that margins should be lower for capital light companies than for capital heavy ones.  
>  
>The R2000 does not have many world-beating firms that have high barriers to entry and that can grow quickly organically without significant capital investment. Anecdotally, private equity has taken out many of the higher quality, smaller companies, leaving the R2000 with a negative survivor bias. This is difficult to prove, but the pedestrian return on capital metrics show that the index does not deserve a stratospheric multiple

For non-financial companies only, the Net Debt to EBIT = 6.3x for the index, 4.7x excluding the losses of making companies, and 4.6x excluding the net debt and losses of loss making companies.

These market cycles have lasted between 21 and 35+ years. Interest rates have been rising since 2016, however, we do not know whether or not 2016 marked the end of the 35-year interest rate bull market starting in 1981.

While interest rates are nominal, history shows that earnings of businesses adjust over time to inflation. Therefore, comparing interest rates (nominal) with P/Es or earnings yields (real) is like comparing apples and oranges. Comparing a 10-year treasury yielding 2.9% today vs. 12.4% in December 1980 in the context of stock market valuation or the attractiveness of buying the 10-year treasury is misleading.  
>  
>Inflation in 1980 was 13.5% and inflation today is 2.1%. Assuming inflation stayed the same in both periods for the ensuing 10 years, the 2.9% treasury today would actually be the more attractive one in real returns. Its real pre-tax return would be better and real after-tax returns tax would be significantly better than the 1980 bond despite the lower nominal yield.  
>  
>Obviously using current inflation for the next 10 years is a stretch and ideally, we could compare TIPS rates which price in expected inflation, however TIPs were only introduced in 1997. I believe real yields (TIPS) relative to stock earnings yields is not perfect but a better comparison than comparing to nominal yields. Based on this assertion I’m not surprised to find essentially no correlation between nominal interest rates and stock market Schiller P/Es. I would expect a stronger correlation between TIPS rates and P/Es but unfortunately no such data exists. I believe this disproves any logic saying that 3% nominal interest rates justify the current valuations.

**In Conclusion**

I think the valuation of the R2000 index is too high, and it's an interesting topic. But I **dont** have a short position on it, as the idea lacks a good catalyst. Maybe the valuation is too high, it's worth discussing.

However, this is a good example of why you cannot take investment advice from strangers on Reddit. u/Goal1 has yet to defend himself, and deleted his post. I think it's safe to say he misrepresented himself. Stole someone else's work. Was not qualified to defend the work, and essentially was masquerading on r/investing as an expert. I hope no one made any financial decisions based upon his original post.",0.79,"[""The user in question has been banned. Don't plagiarize guys. Reddit is a content aggregator so it's fine to post others work, but don't play it off as your own. Analysts put a fuckload of work into their DD so it really sucks to rip that off for useless karma."", '[deleted]', 'rekt', '[deleted]', 'Haha, brutal.\n\nI’m still interested in discussing the question of valuation, if anyone wants to continue that discussion over here, I’ll post my comment from that thread.\n\n>Alright, lets get substantive with a few random points.\nFirst, its tough to use a lot of your numbers because of your unique manipulations. Without historical data normalized to your rounding and averaging, how is anyone supposed to have a frame of reference for how those numbers compare with... anything? The value in such manipulations seems to me that they can give you insights into the numbers that add up to the index: are the index averages more composed of high-PE companies than they are historically and thus rounding them off causes deviations from the “raw” data? etc. Picking a personal methodology to define valuations and then hoping for a catalyst seems more like... well, just a more complicated way of betting on a catalyst which people have been doing based on “high valuations” for 7+ years already without much luck. Actually, there were potential catalysts that actually occurred, we had government shutdowns and unforced policy errors like near technical defaults and the fiscal cliff that were way more compelling than the ones you list here. What is your rough estimation of the probability that one of these catalysts will actually result in a downturn within the next 12 months?\n\n>Second, margins are not actually mean-reverting. They reflect the business conditions of the time (taxes, inflation, relative market power of firms vs. employees vs. consumers, etc.) and so merely pointing out that margins are currently high does not mean that they must fall. For example, if margins are high due to low taxes and automation which allows companies to suppress wage growth for employees, then none of your catalysts actually push down margins and realistically high margins for the foreseeable future rationally explains high valuations. Similarly, margins in indexes (and economy wide) can be growing because they are being concentrated in specialized firms that monopolize their niche. For example, technology allows a larger share of profits to be earned by companies with strong ecosystems that are not able to be penetrated by competitors merely based on the cost of capital (which is what traditionally limits margins). Facebook isn’t susceptible to “Google+” just because Google can or does invest more in their product, there is a network effect that makes Facebook more valuable just because it is already big. The same goes for Google in the realm of search advertising, they can earn unusual margins in their corner of the market because they aren’t susceptible to “normal” competition even from a well funded and determined competitor like Bing/Microsoft. And the same with Apple, who dominates 85%+ of the mobile phone profit share, and on and on and on. If companies are making unusually high profits in “their niche” and that is the “new normal”, then even when a giant falls, it will be to a company who will come to dominate that niche and earn unusually high profits in its place. This also says nothing about the increasing importance of patents and IP to earnings which are de-facto and sanctioned monopolies expected to earn outsized margins.\n\n>Finally, lets talk about the Schiller PE. Averaging 10 years of earnings is a shot at a dartboard and it basically works on average because there is usually an average of one recession represented in the data. However, because of earnings growth, a recession earlier in that 10 years is less significant, and if you enter a period where no recessions are represented at all then you would obviously expect erroneous readings. This is to say that “Schiller PE is high and likely to go much much higher by 2020 as the last recession rolls off the average” isn’t a statement of valuation, it is a statement of “we haven’t had a recession in 10 years”, so betting against the high Schiller valuations is doing nothing more than just betting on a recession because one is “overdue”. On that score, recoveries from financial crises are always and predictably slow. After the worst recession since the Great Depression, it took us more than 6 years to get back to the previous peak employment. Given that we’ve only had genuine economic expansion for a relatively short time, is “betting on a recession being overdue” really a smart move right now?', 'Well based on an AMA he did, he is a self-proclaimed trashy karmawhore who never posts original content.', 'how do u know he isnt the same person who posted it in value investors club?', ""I give this idiot (well, the original author) two weeks before he's panic covering."", ""Who cares?

I'm working hard to develop positive habits that will help me in this game. I LOVE to research, to learn everything about an investment I possibly can before pulling the trigger. It's fun. It reduces stress to go in prepared. I look at the fundamentals and the technicals. Recently I've been using a combination of [finviz.com](https://finviz.com) for screening and news, [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com) for charting the technicals, and cruising through reddit for commentary from peers.

First I decide what sector to research. I like value stocks right now. I think we're in [mid to late cycle](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/markets_sectors/sectors/si_business_cycle.jhtml?tab=sibusiness). The Fed is going to squeeze us and earnings are slowing accross the board. I'm looking for reliable companies with defensive attributes. I like utilities, industrials, healthcare, telecom, secular growth consumer goods. I like the boring stuff that's going to pay its 2% dividend without fail. I like a clean balance sheet and a company with a reliable history of earnings beats. I love a company that meets all of this critera, but still sports a Price/Earnings ratio 20% beneath the sector average. Add quarter/quarter earnings growth and a positive outlook, and we've met my critera. Bonus points for institutional ownership and insider buying.

Once I'm satisfied with the fundamentals, I chart the technicals. Where is this Stock trading relative to its 50, 100, 200 day SMAs? To its 52wk high/low? I like a beat down stock looking to break a key resistance. I won't pull the trigger, though, until I get a technical signal to confirm my fundamental analysis. Maybe that insider buying triggers some market interest and leads to a run, I see a volume spike and the price shoots through the 200 day SMA and breaks a key resistance, formation, or trend-line. Then I'm in.

*ALKS 4230 – Phase I in Immuno-oncology


Alkermes has two big FDA deadlines and events in the upcoming months which will be the focus of this write up.  The first is ALKS 5461 for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder with the FDA advisory committee discussing the NDA application for the drug candidate on November 1st as well as a PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  The second is ALKS 4230 for treatment of Solid Tumors, where they are reporting Phase I initial data in the second half of 2018.  I will be setting 2 dates for this write up to remind investors of the Advisory Meeting/data presentation sometime in the next 2 months, as well as the PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  With multiple catalysts in the pipeline in the next 3 months, Alkermes is an exciting company to watch.


**Specific Drugs:**

**ALKS 5461**

AKLS 5461, buprenorphine/samidorphan, is a k-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist which functions as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).  The buprenorphine is a partial agonist of µ-opioid receptors (MOR), antagonist of the KOR, as well as a slight antagonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and a weak agonist of the nociception receptor (NOP).  Samidorphan on the other hand is a preferential antagonist of the MOR, allowing for the combination of the two to function as a stopper to KORs with negligible activation of MORs.  
Essentially this means that by activating the KOR, opioid peptides which are endogenous ligands of the KOR and function by inversing morphine-like, euphoric endorphins, create a sense of dysphoria and psychotomimetic effects, and are to produce changes in neuroplasticity evoked by chronic stress that has led to the development of depression and CNS disorders and drug addiction.  It is suggested in research that inhibiting the KOR abolishes antidepressant-like effects of buprenorphine, but the drug exhibits both antagonistic and agonist properties.  This has led to the concern that in theory, ALKS-5461 could be limited in the effectiveness of treatment of depression.  

Granted a Fast Track Designation in 2013, the drug has proceeded up to Phase III where thee different trials were initiated for the treatment of depression.  The first two trials failed in 2016, FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, however based on the third trial, FORWARD-5, the company submitted an NDA in 2017 for ALKS-5461.  Things started to look grim for the company moving forward, as the FDA served Alkermes a refuse-to-file letter saying that more data from well-controlled clinical trials must be presented before an application would be recognized.  However, just two weeks after serving the notice, the FDA rescinded their letter and accepted the NDA after productive interactions with Alkermes where the company clarified certain aspects of the NDA.  No further data was needed to rescind the letter and PDUFA date is scheduled by January 31, 2019.

The first two trials failed after the company reported higher placebo responses as the chief obstacle in their studies.  Not something a company would like to hear in relation to an antidepressant medication.  Causing the stock to plummet 44% in 2016, from nearly $80 to under $40, the company has been slowly recovering since.  ALKS-5461’s fate lies in the hands of FORWARD-5, without a clear success and perfect data, an FDA approval seems unlikely for this drug. 

FORWARD-5 focused on two doses of 1mg/1mg and 2mg/2mg of ALKS-5461 for adjunct treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).  Concurrently to taking ALKS-5461, the patients also remained on background antidepressant therapy.  With 407 patients enrolled, 63 received 1mg/1mg, 63 received 2mg/2mg, and 280 received the placebo.  The study was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 was 5 weeks, Stage 2 was 6 weeks. In Stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. For Stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. Depression scores were assessed using the 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) and MADRS-10, an assessment tool for depression.

In the study, ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by 6-item MADRS scores (p=0.018). ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 10-item MADRS scores compared to placebo (p=0.026). The 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS-5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo.  2mg/2mg treatment did show a significant change, warranting its efficacy while also having no incidences of withdrawal or pattern of adverse effects suggesting abuse potential.  The clinical benefit of the compound maintained through 11-week study and the compound is relatively safe and tolerable.  Where FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 failed to meet their endpoints, FORWARD-5 succeed in meeting primary endpoint for the 2mg/2mg dose, showing great efficacy when compared to a placebo.   
November 1st, 2018, the FDA advisory committee is meeting to discuss ALKS-5471 in relation to the compound’s efficacy, safety and risk-benefit profile of the NDA for buprenorphine and samidorphan sublingual tablets for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.  In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee roughly 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  

**ALKS-4230**

Currently in Phase I of development, Alkermes does a change of pace with this immuno-oncology drug for the treatment of solid tumors, making a shift away from their regular market in the CNS disease space.  This drug candidate is an engineered fusion protein comprised of permuted interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 Receptor (IL-2R) α made specifically to only activate the intermediate-affinity IL-2R.  The intermediate-affinity IL-2R is expressed mainly on effector lymphocytes, which are essential in generating an antitumor immune response.  IL-2 is a cell signaling molecule which plays a role in controlling the life cycle of specialized T-cells.  ALKS-4230 selectively binds to intermediate-affinity IL-2R to both activate and increase in number the immune cells that work to battle cancer.  Their selectivity, however, means they don’t bind to the “high-affinity IL-2 receptor,” so as not to trigger greater activity or proliferation in immune cells that could dampen an anti-tumor response Research has suggested that selective activation of the intermediate-affinity IL-2R by ALKS-4230 has the potential to provide enhanced tumor killing as well as improved tolerability. 
ALKS-4230 is currently in Phase I in patients with advanced solid tumors. Key study objectives are to determine a recommended phase 2 dose and characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and evidence of antitumor activity. A dose-escalation phase in patients with refractory solid tumors (Part A) will be followed by expansion cohorts in defined populations (Part B). ALKS 4230 is administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for five days each cycle. The dose will be escalated until reaching maximum tolerated dose or an Optimal Biologic Dose. The first two dose cohorts will use a 3+3 design. Subsequent cohorts in Part A will enroll a minimum of 6 subjects. In Part B up to 21 patients will be enrolled into each of four tumor-specific cohorts. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for PK, immunogenicity and PD assessments. The primary PD endpoint is change-from-baseline in CD8+ T, NK and T reg cell counts. Other PD measures include serum concentrations of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and immunohistochemical assessment of markers of immune activation in tumor tissue from selected patients. 

Animal trials conducted previously were positive and showed the anti-tumor activity of ALKS-4230, both alone and with the checkpoint inhibitors. Rodents treated with ALKS-4230 were seen to have lesser tumor growth and better survival, supporting clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 as a potential immunotherapy in the oncology space. ALKS-4230 will be administered in combination with PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells, complimenting the mechanisms of action from ALKS-4230.  Alkermes has accelerated clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab based on data from the ongoing monotherapy dose-escalation stage of the phase 1 study, where ALKS 4230 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on circulating natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells, and minimal and non-dose dependent effects on immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.  

Initial data from Phase I is due in the second half of 2018, estimated to come out early November.


**Competition and Market:**

ALKS-4230 is a tough market, cancer is a hot sector but it continually sees failure.  While the FDA holds the stance that they want to try to push new oncology and immuno-oncology drugs through the approval process and get them to market to potentially save or extend lives, their decisions tend to skew otherwise.  Being so early on in development, it’s not necessary to dive into the market in depth as there is a large, unmet need in the oncology sector with the main focus being in immuno-oncology.

MDD has a multifaceted and varied etiology, and remains poorly understood. The MDD market is overly crowded and overly competitive, surpassing 30 FDA approved products available for the treatment of patients, the majority of which are now available as inexpensive generics. The MDD market is currently in an active transition where patents are expiring on top-selling products such as Eli Lilly's Cymbalta and Otsuka/BMS' Abilify, paving way for launches of Lundbeck/Takeda's Trintellix and Otsuka/Lundbeck's Rexulti.  These will create a significant growth in the market as cheaper generics will become available.  Growth in the MDD market is also expected to be driven by the potential introduction of numerous promising late-stage pipeline products into the market during the next few years which are directed at treatment-resistant patients.  These products include Alkermes' ALKS-5461, Allergan/Gedeon Richter/Mitsubishi Tanabe's Vraylar, Axsome Therapeutics' AXS-05, Janssen's esketamine, and Allergan's rapastinel.

MDD is the most common mental disorder in the U.S., affecting approximately 16 million American adults, of which about one-third remain untreated. The number of treated patients is projected to rise on account of expiring patents, the increase in available generic products, and rising awareness regarding depression and mental health issues.  This competitive market was priced at a massive $3.2 billion in 2015 and is expected to consistently grow at a CAGR of 6.1% until 2025 to reach $5.8 billion.  With the current social standings of mental health, students being required to take mandatory mental health courses now in many places, and social workers and therapists being more commonplace in schools and work places, we should see a larger surge in my opinion.  Growing female prevalence, increase in prescription spending, and escalating awareness of mental health will propel the growth of this market for many years to come.


**Financials:**

Alkermes has a great financial standing in the biotech industry.  Leveraging both their approved products and impressive collaborations, the company was able to boast a revenue growth of 39% ($304.6 million) through product sales and payments.  Many opportunities lined up for the company and set them up for success this second quarter. 

*Vivitrol sales increased 15% to $76.2 million

*Aristada sales increased 48% to $33.6 million

*Royalties from Johnson & Johnson partnership increased 4% to $85.2 million

*Royalties from Acorda Therapeutics decreased 22% to $19.7 million

*License revenue from Biogen generated $48.3 million in revenue


Despite increased operation costs related to commercializing their products and further research and development, the company posted a Non-GAAP net income of $45.6 million and a Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29. With a total cash balance of $561 million and total debt of $280 million, the company stands on strong ground.  This second half of 2018 has several catalysts, combined with increasing revenues from collaborations and drug approvals, Alkermes is likely to see success, only to be complimented by hopefully positive data from their upcoming Phase I and PDUFA dates. The company is expecting to hit $1 billion in revenues for 2018 as a year, which would be a massive milestone for the pharmaceutical company.


**Review:**

Historically, the FDA has been flexible with depression medications, but failures will weigh Alkermes down.  Depression studies have had a flurry of failures over recent history, and failure here can dissuade further research in the pharmaceutical space until more is known on the biology side.  With over 30 currently approved products on the market for MDD, it is overly saturated and failure can spell the end for the drug.  Following their failures in FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, investors are weary of another failure, especially after the initial NDA was rejected.  Good news is, there is an advisory committee meeting in November to discuss ALKS-5461. In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee only about 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  Chances are from that perspective that the FDA will grant approval.  The compound also shows no suggestion of tolerance of therapeutic effects, the side effect profile was generally comparable to standard medications with no significant late appearing side effects, and when medication was halted there was no sign of opioid withdrawal.  With the competitive, growing market and patents expiring, a new and novel MDD treatment would be a value add.

In the case of the early stage ALKS-4230, oncology drug candidates historically have a 57% possibility of success moving from Phase I to Phase II compared to an industry average of 63.2% possibility of success.  This does shine in comparison to the oncology end success rate of a low 3.4%.  If I were to put my money where my mouth is, I am going with the data and not the suggestive words of the FDA to say that oncology might sound like a great industry with the backing of the FDA, but their actions prove otherwise.  Oncology drugs are more likely to be denied by the FDA and fail their clinical trials at much higher rates than other industries such as vaccines which show an end rate of success over 30%.  I would guess this drug might make it to Phase III with time, but statistically it is unlikely to see approval.  While Phase III or even Phase II are years away from completion, the data in Phase I will likely reveal a lot about the drug to make future estimations off of.  I see Phase I being positive.

Currently the stock is trading around $43 and showing a high level of support and consolidation in this zone.  With a high of over $70 not 7 months ago, the company is likely to recover and soar.  This stock does not take bad news well however, seeing several 10% or more drops over the past year, but never going under $40 for long.  I think between $42-46 are great entries for this stock.  Long term their finances are growing, increasing revenues from royalties and sales of their own approved products, on track to hit $1 billion in revenues this year, and a solid pipeline that shows great promise.  I would bank on good data from ALKS-4230 as well as a positive hearing from the advisory committee.  With the PDUFA date in January, we will see a heavy run up into the end of the year.  I would take advantage of this price entry for either a long-term hold or a swing trade.  I would predict levels of up to $55 in the coming 3 months.

I'm a shareholder and I'm so unsurprised at these numbers quite honestly except for their debt payments being progressive. They've paid down a big chunk of their debt, I'd like to see them dedicate less money to their share buybacks and focus on paying down their debt. Their goodwill write off is disappointing because they overpaid something fierce for Jarden and they're trying to right it by selling off portions (they're nearing a deal with selling Jostens for $1.3B, which will apparently go to paying off their debt). Some of their financial moments come from the new revenue recognition standards, losing distributors for Coleman and losing Toys R Us, which accounted for $55M of their sales last year. Yankee Candle is struggling in Europe and they're losing money in foreign currency. Their operating cash flow has increased substantially, which I like to see, and that management is confident enough to spend that much money in buying back shares, to me, is a sign of confident, albeit inept, leadership. In any event, as a shareholder, the $8.1B impairment hurts something fierce. This is the first time I'm sitting down and trying to process all of this stuff. What do you think of these results? ",0.59,"[""I'm a little disappointed to see that they're accelerating their buyback program while carrying so much debt.\n\nThat said, the morning jump was quite welcome.

It’s generally expected since they clearly overpaid for the Jarden acquisition. The goodwill write off is just a formal acknowledgment of this. It’s mostly an accounting thing. I always discounted their assets previously since they had so much goodwill. \n\nFor share buybacks, you have to remember that they are looking to decrease the size of the company by ~40% if I recall correctly. They need to buy back about 40% of their shares or else the asset sales will be dilutive. At this depressed share price, the purchases are accretive (assuming you agree with the the buy side argument).\n\n', ""I haven't really looked at this in great detail because I just don't see myself having any interest in owning it, but from just a largely surface look, it feels to me like could be a nice win if a turnaround works, but beyond that I just don't think it's a compelling business and management certainly doesn't inspire confidence.

There are safer and more established companies that dominate the market right now and have very high value.  Companies like Blizzard(ATVI), EA(EA), Take-Two(TTWO).  All are great companies to invest in.  But if your looking for a home run type of company here is what I found for Millennial Esports(I hate the company name by the way...)

here is a link to company details.  I hope it works for people that don't have an account on the site...let me know if it doesn't

The company currently doesn't have positive earnings.  You can see that lately the net income has gone down more and the revenue increased a bit.  The reason for this is that the company has recently shifted to mainly focusing on racing esports.  The companies main source of income in the past has been from running esports events in an arena they rent out in vegas.  They are still doing this today but they made some big changes recently.  The biggest one is buying ownership of EDEN GAMES.  This company develops racing games.  It made Test Drive Unlimited Series and V-Rally Series for playstation.  Now it develops mobile games(Gear.Club and just released F1 mobile Racing today with the company Codemasters).  It also has an exclussive game coming out on the Switch on Dec 4th(Gear.Club unlimited 2).  In acquiring Eden Games the company has said that its future focus will be on growing mobile racing as an esport.  Their game has recently been added to Amazon Go eSport tournaments and they will be using their own arena they have in vegas to run events.

Looking at the stock value.  You can see when it initally went public the volume of trades was very high and the stock raised as high as a dollar before crashing down to .10 where it sits now.  This looks like it was a big pump and dump.  But the stock has been sitting at or close to its current value for a while.

For a company like this it comes down to if you see any value in mobile racing as an esport or as a good way to generate revenue. 
 There last financial report was in May shortly after they aquired Eden Games.  The main source of revenue at this point was from game development and any revenue that gear.club(and old mobile game developed by EDEN games a couple years back).  The next financial will be at the end of the year.  The main source will be from royalties they make from the  F1 Mobile Racing game, gear.club unlimitted 2 being released in Dec, and development for new games coming out in 2019.  The value being so low isn't taking into account the potential future of the company.  So if someone is interested in investing in this company I suggest looking up past racing mobile games to see how popular they were and how much revenue you would expect coming in from games that Millennial Esports will be releasing.  And most of all if you think that racing games have any kind of future in esports.

Or check out the Twitch gaming channels that have hundreds of thousands of viewers at any time of the day.\n\nI’m still not getting into it as an investment because the concept is lost on me.  But it has potential.  I wouldn’t go with this pennystock you’re questioning though.  I’d check out $ESPO.  It’s an esports etf that includes some of the big boys like $EA.\n\nDisclosure:  I invested in EA back in ~2011 when it was around $10/sh.  Sold in the mid $11’s.  It’s currently sitting at $106.17.  One of my biggest regrets.', ""I'm sceptical of any specific investment in esports until something like soccer emerges.

I don't like the racing genre, and I don't like this companies chances in venturing into other games when there are already orgs that have the connections. I do think there could be opportunity in creating a better run business than the current even organizers like ESL and PGL, but the space is SO risky at the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut my question is why do you want to invest into event orgs, when the people who make the real money are the team organizations and the game developers. We have seen the industry change from these 3rd party event orgs having free reign over their tournaments/broadcasting rights/sponsors, to game developers either working inhouse or expecting a lot of control over the event. It wouldn't shock me that when these companies get bigger they end up buying orgs like ESL themselves, which ATVI did with MLG. Even then a lot of these events aren't profitable unless you are in the biggest games with the best broadcasting deals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven with how big mobile games are getting, who's making the money? The company that hosts the 1 mil clash royale tournament, or super cell?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe best e-sport investment right now is ATVI hands down.

One thing that was surprising was that the gaming industry brought in more money than the global film and music industry combined! But if you look at trends, the mobile gaming industry is overtaking the console and pc gaming when looking at revenue. Therefore, it is understandable that ATVI is investing in that arena. They want to increase profits, like any other company. So, this debacle, may be temporary for the company but long term they will have better financials. Remember EA, their stock dipped on their Star Wars debacle but shortly after, they reached their 52 week high. So yeah, short them if you want but I would caution that this will be temporary. Think about it, this is their biggest foray into the mobile platform and whether or not it’s a huge success, it will increase revenue. That’s my take. I have chosen not to enter into a position on atvi, ttwo, and ea but I do think these traditional gaming companies, have a chance to gain market share from strictly mobile gaming services like zynga and ten cent due to brand loyalty.

Games themselves and/or the ecosystem around gaming like the hardware required. Or even a non traditional investment.

A graphics card maker maybe, like Nvidia? They can make revenue from things other than just gaming, which I like. It looks like these powerful chips may play an important role powering other things in medicine, autos, even AI.
What about stocks like Tencent? Maybe a giant like Amazon or Apple will get into gaming?

I was absolutely right. I sold when they were up 13 points in the morning... but it ended up 30 points by the end of the day.

&#x200B;

I took that money and bought an Amazon Call for 1,100 dollars about 30 min after the market opened. It was up maybe 25 or 26 points then. Wasn't expecting much... Shot up 115 points by the end of the day. Still have it... so I will probably see a slight sell off in the morning.

&#x200B;

I knew marijuana was going to spike due to the recent elections which voted in 2 states to legalize marijuana. So I bought several calls on Tilray TLRY. A Canadian marijuana company with only 9 million shares so it has volatility. What was a surprise was Jeff Sessions turning in his resignation. Signaling a buy for everyone on Marijuana stocks. TLRY spiked near the end of the day up 32 points.

&#x200B;

All in all... I made 340% from yesterdays market close to todays market close.

&#x200B;

I did buy a ROKU call for ER after market close... for fun. Looks like I lost that one for sure. Beat earnings but a weak forecast for this coming holiday sent it tanking. Also thought I lost on a TTWO call... but they had really bad numbers and tried to fix it by saying RDR2 sales are 18% above what they had predicted. So far... shot up 8 points but with the volatility loss...

**POLITICS**  
**1. The FBI is investigating a suspected smear attempt against Special Counsel Robert Mueller,** the head of the ongoing investigation into Russian election interference. A woman reached out to several journalists on October 17 claiming she had been offered money to make sexual misconduct claims against Mueller. Mueller's office immediately [referred the matter to the FBI](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/robert-mueller-fbi-hoax).  


**BUSINESS**  
**2. Elon Musk fired (and replaced) at least 7 senior leaders of the SpaceX management team** in an effort to accelerate the timeline of Starlink. Starlink is SpaceX’s attempt at providing global internet connectivity via a constellation of satellites. It’s key to SpaceX’s more ambitious plans (i.e., Mars travel) given it could provide shorter term cash to fund continued space technology development. The mandate of the replacement team is to launch the [first batch of satellites by mid-2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spacex-starlink-insight/musk-shakes-up-spacex-in-race-to-make-satellite-launch-window-sources-idUSKCN1N50FC).

Australia became the 6th nation to ratify the agreement triggering a 60-day countdown. The revised version is called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).  


*More context: The original TPP was in jeopardy after President Trump withdrew from negotiations; however, the remaining 11 nations finalized a revised version in January.*  


**TECH**  
**4. Waymo first to receive California approval to test self-driving cars with no backup driver** in the front seat.

Just a note that of the companies below only 1 had an earnings release this week (Walgreens), so that can be struck off as the reason for these stocks' contra-market move.

TRIP11-07,9qsyzy,"Millennial in Wealth Management here. And we are facing a very Real Problem.... I see a toxic narrative guiding a generation of Americans who, we as an industry, have failed to reach. Somehow, professionals ecessary behavioral and life coaching",1540327687.0,40,0,"Whether the professionals became too comfortable, or just plain worn down, I'm not exactly sure. But I am certain that the winning narrative is resulting in a generation of Americans without a very necessary behavioral, financial coach.

Being in the industry, and being a millennial, I get it. I understand the attractiveness of the Betterment / Wealthfront / Robinhood platforms powered by technology, with slick front end appearance and seamless process that walks you into a customized portfolio. It's approachable. It's a modern feel vs. some stiff, suit wearing bank....I get it.

I also see the flood on the horizon, and no-one building an arch. The same way Facebook, in a relentless push to advance technology and connect the world, has strangely found itself at the helm with responsibilities and geopolitical pressures no-one could have forseen. From a goofy data mining platform who's goal was to connect kids at university , to sitting in front of Congress defending itself against systematic privacy violations and aiding a foreign intervention in our political elections.

Technology moves fast and the next victim was financial services. And while advisors were busy defending themselves at every turn, new companies filled the void....seemingly unaware of the responsibility that accompanies this position.

With that said, take your favorite new advisor replacement, peel back the onion - and what are you really getting?

\- ""It's low cost"" - Good. Of course it is. What industry has not faced a lower cost competitive army backed by technology. What hasn't been commoditized? The consumer expects everything to be free. Take musicians for example. They either live on the road, or they starve.

*I was watching ESPN the other day, and with a mike to his face, Lebron smiled and said.... “I’ll take the ads.” I had to rewind it for the question - and it was his response when asked if he pays for the premium service on Pandora. It's our expectations.*

Anyway, this race to zero is completely ridiculous and a complete distraction.

""Well"", you say, ""clearly I should be conscience of fees and aware that Wall Street simply wants to rob working people blind. So yes fees are top of the list. I worked for this money.""

Understood. However, a complaint shouldn't drive a life changing behavioral decision. You don't argue about the bill if your son or daughter is sick. You want the best. You consider costs obviously....

So, all we hear about are fees....take a second to walk with me here.

America is the richest society on the planet yet 60% of families are living pay check to pay check. Only 2 of 5 Americans spend less than they make. *Let that sink in. The majority of our country is literally tightening handcuffs around their wrists and opting into indentured servitude. That's what they are.* Buy now pay for it later. The average car loan today is 72 months (5 years), as dealerships have introduced 7 year loans on 2019 models. The average 60 year old has $50,000 in retirement accounts. To put that in perspective, in a world where pensions don't exist anymore and Social Security is on the brink, no one is being taught to save money. \*On lunch alone, the average American couple will spend $250,000 over the course of retirement."" On lunch!! Now add inflation. Yeah! On feeding themselves a meal between breakfast and dinner.

Where is the wealth management industry? Standing there frozen...like a goalie watching the ball roll by, as our culture is consistently borrowing from the future in pursuit of comfort today.

I've never seen ""fees"" wreck someones retirement plan. Conversely, Bad Advise wrecks lives.

""*When the tide pulls out, you get to see who was swimming naked.""* \-Warren

It's all great when the market goes up - but your going to keep feeding money into a robot during a down market?

""Well I get my fee returned if I am not satisfied."" That's great. In 2008, everything, even a diversified customized portfolio was down 30+%...

But you got the $40 management fee back!

&#x200B;

We have lost control of the narrative. Because if your advisor or team can instill discipline, guide you through a period like 2008, hold you accountable, plan for and maximize retirement savings, set your kids up for tax free access to cash when they are choosing a school, and teach you financial independence.... what wouldn't you pay? Seriously. 3% 5% 20%? What difference would it make if your net outcome was financially independent.

You paid 8% on the bag of chips last trip to Whole Foods. We are walking blindly down a path of complete chaos if the financial services industry does not weed out the bad eggs and begin to work at educating the future of this country. Doctors are respected. CPAs are respected. Financial Advisors are your behavioral life coach on the path to financial independence. That's important.

Think about this next time you buy into the toxic narritive, or better yet, you stamp that free one way ticket into a brick wall.

The company currently doesn't have positive earnings.  You can see that lately the net income has gone down more and the revenue increased a bit.  The reason for this is that the company has recently shifted to mainly focusing on racing esports.  The companies main source of income in the past has been from running esports events in an arena they rent out in vegas.  They are still doing this today but they made some big changes recently.  The biggest one is buying ownership of EDEN GAMES.  This company develops racing games.  It made Test Drive Unlimited Series and V-Rally Series for playstation.  Now it develops mobile games(Gear.Club and just released F1 mobile Racing today with the company Codemasters).  It also has an exclussive game coming out on the Switch on Dec 4th(Gear.Club unlimited 2).  In acquiring Eden Games the company has said that its future focus will be on growing mobile racing as an esport.  Their game has recently been added to Amazon Go eSport tournaments and they will be using their own arena they have in vegas to run events.

Looking at the stock value.  You can see when it initally went public the volume of trades was very high and the stock raised as high as a dollar before crashing down to .10 where it sits now.  This looks like it was a big pump and dump.  But the stock has been sitting at or close to its current value for a while.

For a company like this it comes down to if you see any value in mobile racing as an esport or as a good way to generate revenue. 
 There last financial report was in May shortly after they aquired Eden Games.  The main source of revenue at this point was from game development and any revenue that gear.club(and old mobile game developed by EDEN games a couple years back).  The next financial will be at the end of the year.  The main source will be from royalties they make from the  F1 Mobile Racing game, gear.club unlimitted 2 being released in Dec, and development for new games coming out in 2019.  The value being so low isn't taking into account the potential future of the company.  So if someone is interested in investing in this company I suggest looking up past racing mobile games to see how popular they were and how much revenue you would expect coming in from games that Millennial Esports will be releasing.  And most of all if you think that racing games have any kind of future in esports.

DIS11-08,9sfy7k,$DIS - immune to market sell-off and a good time to invest,1540838649.0,18,8,"Hello!

&#x200B;

With all this uncertainty in the market and the wild fluctuations we are seeing - I don't think right now is a bad time to invest in Disney. 

&#x200B;

Why? 

&#x200B;

1.) Check it's 3 month performance - it's been immune to this crazy ride we've seen over the last few months and has endured just fine with October's correction/borderline correction. When the market does well it'll ride to the $116-119 mark and when it all goes south it'll hit the floor of $110 at worst

2.) Not terrible dividend - not much to say on this - it's not great but you can count on them not cutting it

3.) Streaming service - it's going to be a hit and will A) capture an untapped market in streaming for children. Netflix has tried it but too little, too late, most parents with children complain that they simply don't have enough offerings to keep their child entertained exclusively, Disney will be able to do that. B) They will have majority ownership of Hulu and can pump family offerings to their Disney service, Adult offerings to Hulu 

4.) Diversification - they are going to have income streams from many different avenues (ESPN - Streaming - Disney Parks - Box office - Toys - Cruising) 

5.) Last but not least, a mote - No one can become the next Disney. The brand is simply too strong with too many diversified products that cannot be duplicated  - they will be here for the long-term

&#x200B;

I'm biased because I am long on Disney and it's my 2nd largest holding, but I do believe in this turbulent market they are a safe buy and you can use it to hedge your portfolio from the loses we are seeing. The million dollar question is going to be how they do in the next recession (not arguing when it's going to happen, but just that it will happen eventually) Disney didn't do so hot in 08-09 but I hope this time they are diversified enough to protect themselves from slumping consumer optimism. The question will be will consumers continue to pay streaming subscriptions or will they cancel them to shrink the budget.

DIS11-08,9n31xf,Introducing the White Girl Index,1539202369.0,627,3692,"I talked about the idea [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9mvabs/z/e7htx2q), and it's a simple one, but potentially lucrative. All that needs to be done is identify public companies with major product lines enjoyed particularly by basic white girls and equal weight them. Intuitively it makes sense; these are customers with money and the ability to set cultural trends. Here is the American white girl index as I currently have it:

* AAPL

* DECK

* DIS

* EL

* FB

* LB

* LULU

* NKE

* SBUX

* UAA

* ULTA

* VFC

If we add foreign stocks, we can include these:

* ADDYY

* DEO

* LRLCY

* LVMUY

I don't remember the rest of what we came up with, but regardless, backtest and behold. White girls crush the market.

EDIT: I'm back in this thread, and I agree about several of the proposed additions, most notably TIF. A lot of you are asking why I left out SNAP, though. I simply forgot about it, but even if I didn't, it's been public for such a short time that it would screw up any decent backtest, and I would probably not include a company with no history of positive EPS anyways. That said, if any of you put some money into a scheme like this, feel free to add or subtract whatever you want. I am powerless to stop you.

EDIT2: In accordance with community consensus, we can go ahead and add these:

* ETSY

* FIZZ

* GOOS

* NFLX

* SNAP

* TGT

* TIF

I personally would decline to add a couple of those due either to very recent IPOs or a lack of history of profitability, but they do fit the stereotypes.",0.9,"[""Because I didn't know some of them, I looked up each company.

That means more opportunities to recoup costs.\n4) synergies - because of tv, films and parks, they have multiple partnerships and avenues to generate publicity for their content\n5) ESPN - something Netflix has no answer for"", ""I'm not sure that a Disney streaming service will necessarily be as great as everyone thinks it will be, and it might not increase the stock price that much for a couple reasons:\n\n1.

That's why everyone is stuck with Youtube for user generated video content and the reason that Twitch was garbage until Amazon bought them. There are only a couple dozen companies in the world that could build Disney's streaming site and if they're doing it all in house it's probably either going to be a buggy mess at launch or be years before it's released.\n\n2. It might be less profitable than what Disney's doing right now. It'll almost certainly result in less sales of physical media and could also negatively impact box office numbers. Maybe the profits from subscriptions will make up for that, but the financials might not be as good for Disney as everyone thinks."", 'Updated the video link, sorry I posted the wrong link earlier ', 'I\'m a long time DIS investor, and people are making some strong bullish cases for it. I\'m still bullish for many reasons, but here\'s my bear case. Disney\'s goals that they\'ve set for 2019 are huge goals, that will need to utilize a lot of resources, and finances to accomplish. Also, these goals are incredibly ambitious. That being said, I\'m gonna continue to hold DIS stock until at least 2030, and have no plans to sell, and in fact they represent about 11% of my portfolio, and I\'m completely overexposed to them, and I\'m OK with that risk. \n\nThey will likely have to sell a bunch of bonds to reach these goals sustainably, and they also probably won\'t reach them by the end of 2019. Also for perspective, DIS has traded flat for about 3 years. Keep that in mind, as these ""huge moves"" Disney has made haven\'t moved the needle, and will likely move the other direction in 6 months when Bob iger realizes how many billions of dollars he still needs to fund his strategy.\n\nAs they expand their streaming sports service across the US, through their contract with BAMtech (which I believe they own outright now) there will be some hurdles to delivering decent sports streaming services in 2019. Surges of activity is one, and being able to deal with ""Superbowl"" levels of sudden streaming surges, as millions of Americans all want to watch the same sports ball event at the same time, without any glitches. This will be a heavy load on servers, and that will be expensive to operate, even when the servers aren\'t at peak capacity. \n\nESPN. That piece of DIS is a piece of shit, it\'s a drag on revenue, and they really need to turn it into 2 or 3 channels already, they really need to scrap the executive team, get innovators, and completely restructure contracts with all the major leagues so that they aren\'t paying the most for the contract and delivering content that isn\'t garanteed to be watched heavily. The entire viewer sports sector has a pretty ridiculously exploitative business model in general, especially college sports, but that\'s another conversation entirely. \n\nThe Disney streaming service will have a bunch if expensive hurdles to deliver their service worldwide by 2019. Yes, there is this little business called AWS and azure that they can pay for to operate their streaming content. Yes they will own Hulu by then. Yes they will own a bunch of services that can deliver the content. But can they deliver the entire Disney library of all their animated movies to Australia, on a weekend, by July of 2019? Can they translate all of their marvel movies into Spanish for South America, and Brazilian Portuguese for Brazil? What if they need to deliver that content to India? To the UK? To all of Europe? Can they stream all of the pixar movies in China? China has a voracious appetite for content, and favorites  spread like wildfire there, but what if the next Wall-E movie has a subversive message? What if the next finding Nemo has record breaking viewership numbers in China, and their servers are simply unable to keep up with demand?  Keep in mind this is their entire content library they\'re talking about doing this with, Disney movies and shows. ABC. Fox. Marvel. Star wars. The new movies, the old movies. Everything. This is a monumental undertaking, and 2019 is an ambitious goal. What if Amazon and AWS simply cut Disney off from using their data centers, as Disney is a direct competitor? \n\nThe parks sector, domestically and internationally, I have no problems with. This sector will be fine, and continues to beat revenue expectations year over year.

If we are to include companies that lose money, the P/E increases to 62.7x. There’s no precise way to measure the index’s valuation given the issues that money losing companies (\~35% of the index by number and \~25% by market value) present.

>Bulls touting the 21x PE commit a sin of omission, while bears citing a 62.7x P/E capitalize negative earnings for companies that investors judge worth significant positive values.

Let’s assume that the index is composed of 2,000 companies, each with a $1bn value.

While I’m quick to point out the flaws with the two most common valuation methods, i do not have an obviously better solution. However, through looking at the valuation in a number of ways, I feel comfortable that i’m “approximately right rather than precisely wrong.”

Moreover, it’s difficult to suspend the laws of economics for a large and diversified set of companies. One would expect a set of 2,000 companies to produce average return metrics. The median ROE of profitable companies is 9.7% and the weighted average ROE is 17.4%.

A more generous definition of return on capital (NOPAT / PPE + CA - CL) for profitable companies produces an average and median return of 17.4% and 11.9%, respectively (I round down ROIs >100% to 100% to avoid distorting the averages). Theses returns are based on 2017 earnings relative to 2016/2017 IC.

>These returns came during a strong economic year and are likely to be lower on a mid/through the cycle basis.

While interest rates are nominal, history shows that earnings of businesses adjust over time to inflation.

Comparing a 10-year treasury yielding 2.9% today vs. 12.4% in December 1980 in the context of stock market valuation or the attractiveness of buying the 10-year treasury is misleading.

>Inflation in 1980 was 13.5% and inflation today is 2.1%. Assuming inflation stayed the same in both periods for the ensuing 10 years, the 2.9% treasury today would actually be the more attractive one in real returns. Its real pre-tax return would be better and real after-tax returns tax would be significantly better than the 1980 bond despite the lower nominal yield.

>Obviously using current inflation for the next 10 years is a stretch and ideally, we could compare TIPS rates which price in expected inflation, however TIPs were only introduced in 1997. I believe real yields (TIPS) relative to stock earnings yields is not perfect but a better comparison than comparing to nominal yields. Based on this assertion I’m not surprised to find essentially no correlation between nominal interest rates and stock market Schiller P/Es. I would expect a stronger correlation between TIPS rates and P/Es but unfortunately no such data exists. I believe this disproves any logic saying that 3% nominal interest rates justify the current valuations.

**In Conclusion**

I think the valuation of the R2000 index is too high, and it's an interesting topic. But I **dont** have a short position on it, as the idea lacks a good catalyst. Maybe the valuation is too high, it's worth discussing.

However, this is a good example of why you cannot take investment advice from strangers on Reddit. u/Goal1 has yet to defend himself, and deleted his post. I think it's safe to say he misrepresented himself. Stole someone else's work. Was not qualified to defend the work, and essentially was masquerading on r/investing as an expert. I hope no one made any financial decisions based upon his original post.",0.79,"[""The user in question has been banned. Don't plagiarize guys. Reddit is a content aggregator so it's fine to post others work, but don't play it off as your own. Analysts put a fuckload of work into their DD so it really sucks to rip that off for useless karma."", '[deleted]', 'rekt', '[deleted]', 'Haha, brutal.\n\nI’m still interested in discussing the question of valuation, if anyone wants to continue that discussion over here, I’ll post my comment from that thread.\n\n>Alright, lets get substantive with a few random points.\nFirst, its tough to use a lot of your numbers because of your unique manipulations. Without historical data normalized to your rounding and averaging, how is anyone supposed to have a frame of reference for how those numbers compare with... anything? The value in such manipulations seems to me that they can give you insights into the numbers that add up to the index: are the index averages more composed of high-PE companies than they are historically and thus rounding them off causes deviations from the “raw” data? etc. Picking a personal methodology to define valuations and then hoping for a catalyst seems more like... well, just a more complicated way of betting on a catalyst which people have been doing based on “high valuations” for 7+ years already without much luck. Actually, there were potential catalysts that actually occurred, we had government shutdowns and unforced policy errors like near technical defaults and the fiscal cliff that were way more compelling than the ones you list here. What is your rough estimation of the probability that one of these catalysts will actually result in a downturn within the next 12 months?\n\n>Second, margins are not actually mean-reverting. They reflect the business conditions of the time (taxes, inflation, relative market power of firms vs. employees vs. consumers, etc.) and so merely pointing out that margins are currently high does not mean that they must fall. For example, if margins are high due to low taxes and automation which allows companies to suppress wage growth for employees, then none of your catalysts actually push down margins and realistically high margins for the foreseeable future rationally explains high valuations. Similarly, margins in indexes (and economy wide) can be growing because they are being concentrated in specialized firms that monopolize their niche. For example, technology allows a larger share of profits to be earned by companies with strong ecosystems that are not able to be penetrated by competitors merely based on the cost of capital (which is what traditionally limits margins). Facebook isn’t susceptible to “Google+” just because Google can or does invest more in their product, there is a network effect that makes Facebook more valuable just because it is already big. The same goes for Google in the realm of search advertising, they can earn unusual margins in their corner of the market because they aren’t susceptible to “normal” competition even from a well funded and determined competitor like Bing/Microsoft. And the same with Apple, who dominates 85%+ of the mobile phone profit share, and on and on and on. If companies are making unusually high profits in “their niche” and that is the “new normal”, then even when a giant falls, it will be to a company who will come to dominate that niche and earn unusually high profits in its place. This also says nothing about the increasing importance of patents and IP to earnings which are de-facto and sanctioned monopolies expected to earn outsized margins.\n\n>Finally, lets talk about the Schiller PE. Averaging 10 years of earnings is a shot at a dartboard and it basically works on average because there is usually an average of one recession represented in the data. However, because of earnings growth, a recession earlier in that 10 years is less significant, and if you enter a period where no recessions are represented at all then you would obviously expect erroneous readings. This is to say that “Schiller PE is high and likely to go much much higher by 2020 as the last recession rolls off the average” isn’t a statement of valuation, it is a statement of “we haven’t had a recession in 10 years”, so betting against the high Schiller valuations is doing nothing more than just betting on a recession because one is “overdue”. On that score, recoveries from financial crises are always and predictably slow. After the worst recession since the Great Depression, it took us more than 6 years to get back to the previous peak employment. Given that we’ve only had genuine economic expansion for a relatively short time, is “betting on a recession being overdue” really a smart move right now?', 'Well based on an AMA he did, he is a self-proclaimed trashy karmawhore who never posts original content.', 'how do u know he isnt the same person who posted it in value investors club?', ""I give this idiot (well, the original author) two weeks before he's panic covering."", ""Who cares?

HD11-13,9o9w1u,Sears files for bankruptcy,1539581074.0,639,3666,"Per CNBC - After years of [Sears Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SHLD) staying afloat through financial maneuvering and relying on billions of CEO Eddie Lampert's own money, the 125-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy.

The filing comes more than a decade after Lampert merged Sears and Kmart, hoping that forging together the two struggling discounters would create a more formidable competitor.

It comes after Lampert [shed assets and spun out real estate](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/eddie-lampert-says-sears-is-shrinking-shedding-assets-to-stay-alive.html), all to pay down the debt the retailer accumulated when that plan went askew. The company still has roughly 700 stores, which have at times been barren, unstocked by vendors who have lost their trust. Many of the stores have never been visited by a generation of shoppers that can barely recall it was once the the country's biggest retailer.

Lampert, who has a controlling ownership stake in Sears, personally holds some 31 percent of the retailer's shares outstanding, according to FactSet. His hedge fund ESL Investments owns about 19 percent.

Ultimately, it was a $134 million payment that did the company in. The company had a payment due Monday it had not the money to pay.

Other forces were at play too. Sears' creditors refused to agree to a [restructuring proposal](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/sears-ceo-proposes-restructuring-plan-to-avoid-bankruptcy.html). They had little assurance by way of collateral or strategy, after years upon years in which Sears' only shot at survival came by selling off parts of its business. Over 42 quarters, only one yielded positive same-store sales growth. As of late September, Sears tallied $5.6 billion in current debt.

Its board was in a perilous spot. Its special committee was tasked with approving Lampert's other plan, [a bid to buy his storied Kenmore appliance business and other brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/eddie-lamperts-hedge-fund-esl-proposes-to-buy-kenmore-brand-sears-real-estate.html). Approving his offer would have helped Sears make its payment. But it would also thrust the board the spotlight, potentially opening them to the threat of litigation from shareholders who might allege Lampert has stripped the business bare.

#### Homes to Hardware

That business was once a giant. It started with Richard Sears, [who launched the Sears Watch Co. in 1886](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html) to sell watches by mail. The company later evolved into Sears, Roebuck and Co., which sold everything from homes to hardware through a catalog. The convenience brought its products to America's most rural locations.

In 1925, Sears morphed a mail-order plant on Chicago's West Side into its first retail store. By the end of the year. Sears opened seven more stores. Eventually, Sears became the largest U.S. retailer, and its house brands like Kenmore and Craftsman earned spots as staples in homes across the country. Generations of children marked the holidays by paging through its holiday catalog, known as the ""Wishbook,"" wondering if they would receive any of the toys inside.

As Sears success grew, so did its empire. It moved into Chicago's iconic Sears Tower, and for a time, owned financial services businesses like Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group.

But [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) topped Sears as the biggest U.S. retailer in 1990. Its efforts to attract female shoppers by showing them the ""softer side of Sears"" and move into new businesses lines left it without a identity.

Those challenges didn't stop Lampert, the hedge fund manager who had already impressed Wall Street with his acumen when he seemingly turned around Kmart, which he bought in 2004. He acquired and combined Sears with Kmart in 2005, arguing that two ailing retailers were stronger together than apart. The financial guru saw valuable real estate, customers he could parlay from one store to the other and ample costs to cut.

The retail giant he created had a market capitalization north of $20 billion in 2006. The media began to wonder whether he was the ""next Warren Buffett."" Lampert could have sold off his investments then, but stayed on, steadfast in his vision of the combined retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) kept opening stores, as did [Lowe's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LOW)and [Home Depot](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HD). Walmart touted its ""everyday low prices,"" while Target served up ""cheap chic."" Lowe's and Home Depot provided a wider array of home improvement products for all kinds of projects, making it tough for Kenmore and Craftsman to compete.

Then, came a double blow.

Consumer spending slowed during the Great Recession, especially for big-ticket items like washers and dryers. Cash-strapped shoppers began using the internet to hunt down the best deals. Gradually, they began to spend more online and avoid the mall, fueling Amazon's rise. Sears' 140,000-square-foot stores began to seem monstrous as foot traffic declined.

Walmart and others began to invest in their businesses to compete with Amazon, but Sears never had that chance. It simply didn't have the funds.

Sears' last profitable year was in 2010. A thinning cash flow has left little money to put back into the company itself, letting it become more irrelevant. For the past five years, the ratio of Sears' capital expenditures to sales has been less than one percent. That's even as its sales have more than halved in the same time period.

Sears has been in survival mode for more than a decade. Unable to rely on the Sears' business to pay the bills, [Lampert instead sold or spun off many of its most valuable stores and brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html).

Since its merger with Kmart, Sears has spun off its Lands' End clothing brand, sold the Craftsman tool brand to [Stanley Black & Decker](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/) and closed hundreds of stores. It spun out 250 of its best properties into real estate investment trust offshoot known as [Seritage](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SRG).

It has been grappling with a pension of roughly 100,000 retirees that, as of January 2018, was underfunded by $1.5 billion, according FactSet.

It became a guessing game among analysts and onlookers whether each of Sears' last five holiday seasons would be its last. But Lampert kept surprising them, extending a lifeline in the form of loans from his hedge fund ESL Investments, or finding them elsewhere, each time bankruptcy looked inevitable.

Lampert, though, sounded the alarm in a Sept. 13 [blog post](https://blog.searsholdings.com/eddie-lampert/update-on-our-transformation/). He pleaded for Sears' creditor's to agree to restructure, calling out the risks should they drag their feet.

""We continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern, rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value,"" he wrote.

By early October, it became evident that Sears' last Christmas before bankruptcy had already passed. Sears began to [raise emergency financing to support the business through coming filing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/sears-arranges-financing-for-a-potential-bankruptcy.html).

NVDA11-15,9rnngz,"Understanding the SEMI cycle.MU, NVDA, AMD, TXN, $SOX",1540580891.0,14,12,"I though I would write a short post for some of the youngins here who have never experienced a real correction or know what a market cycle is. 

1) The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful

2) Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its  always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually  cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months  there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler  data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.  

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom.

TGT11-20,9yrybl,"Target shares tumble 9% as earnings miss mark, weighed down by higher costs",1542718864.0,40,82,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/target-reports-q3-2018-earnings.html

* * *
TGT on Tuesday reported a mixed quarter, with revenue slightly topping analysts estimates but earnings falling short, as investments in its supply chain weighed on profits.

Despite the earnings miss, Target maintained its forecast for the full year, and said it's ""better positioned for this holiday season than ever before.""

Its shares were down 9 percent in premarket trading after falling as much as 10 percent.

Here's what Target reported for its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a poll of analysts by Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.09, adjusted, vs. $1.12 expected
Revenue: $17.82 billion vs. $17.80 billion expected
Same-store sales: up 5.1 percent vs. growth of 5.2 percent expected
Net income grew to $622 million, or $1.17 per share, compared with $478 million, or 87 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Target earned $1.09 per share, short of expectations for $1.12 per share, based on a survey by Refinitiv.

Total revenue climbed 5.6 percent from a year ago to $17.82 billion, slightly beating analysts' estimates.

Sales at Target stores open for at least 12 months were up 5.1 percent, slightly short of expectations for growth of 5.2 percent. The company said digital sales rose 49 percent during the third quarter and contributed 1.9 percentage points to same-store sales growth. It said the number of transactions at its stores jumped 5.3 percent, while the average shopper's ticket dropped 0.2 percent.

Target said its strongest sales gains during the quarter came from the toys, baby and beauty categories. The company has notably been devoting more space in some stores to sell toys following the demise of Toys R Us.

But investors were concerned about how higher expenses were eating into profits. Target's third-quarter gross margin rate fell to 28.7 percent from 29.6 percent a year ago, with the company attributing the decline to higher supply chain costs as it fulfills more online orders ahead of the holiday season. It also said it ordered more holiday-related inventory ahead of the fourth quarter, earlier than when it did last year.

Target continues to expect adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year to fall within a range of $5.30 to $5.50. For the holiday quarter, it's anticipating same-store sales will be up roughly 5 percent.

""We plan to leverage our current momentum into 2019,"" CEO Brian Cornell said in a statement.

But first, Target has to prove it can keep the momentum going through this holiday season, where some companies can make as much as 30 percent of their annual sales. The retailer has been pouring money into store renovations, while opening up smaller-format locations in urban cities and college towns. It continues to add more in-house brands for apparel and home goods, which offer higher margins than national labels. And it's investing in logistics to be more competitive with Walmart and Amazon. This holiday season, for example, Target is dropping its minimum purchase threshold for free, two-day shipping, while Walmart still has a $35 threshold.

Target also said Tuesday it has met its hiring goals for the holidays to bring on 120,000 seasonal workers. There's been some concern, more broadly, that retailers won't be able to meet these lofty hiring goals with such a tight labor market in the U.S.

As of Monday's market close, Target shares have rallied more than 35 percent over the past 12 months, bringing its market cap to roughly $41.1 billion.",0.91,"[""Target is positioning itself nicely IMO. All the stores I have been in recently have been renovated. That can't be cheap.

- Funding.  Setting up an infrastructure is incredibly expensive.  Do they have legitimate funding or is this going to turn into a giant Ponzi scheme?

DE11-21,9rftzf,Market perspective from an investment firm,1540512985.0,73,132,"So I'd like to give my two cents as i feel a lot of these posts dig into the technicals of certain stocks and i feel like no one ever talks about the broad markets.

&#x200B;

Background on me; i work on the sales desk of an investment firm on the east coast that manages 450 billion in assets and i directly cover the big wirehouses. What does this mean? Financial Advisors that manage hundreds of millions of dollars from UBS, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo Advisors, Etc. call me up and ask me how to allocate money into their portfolios using our funds, SMAs and private placements. The following are the themes that the biggest FAs ask about the most.

&#x200B;

Rising rates: obviously we are in a rising rate environment which means that fixed income has severe headwinds. We think that money should be allocated to fixed income that has low overall duration. The spread between a 2 and 10 year treasury is around 30-50 bps which means you are still being compensated well on the shorter part of the curve. digging into munis the following stats apply: a 5 year muni bond gets around 70% of the 30 year yield curve, a 10 year muni gets 80% of the yield curve and a 15 year bond gets 90% of the yield curve. this obviously shows the yield curve is flattening and the most highest yield per duration spot is around 5-10 years.

&#x200B;

credit spreads: credit spreads are at all time lows. the amount of compensation between BBB to AAA is as low as it was in 2007. what does this mean? you should look for good yields in fixed income but you shouldn't take on too much credit risk when doing so.

&#x200B;

Equities: equities are coming off a 10 year bull run. however, many technicals are pointing to the bull run continuing and the recession still being in the distant future. we prefer to look at corporate profits as an indicator to how profitable equities are. Though there has been recent volatility companies are still making profits and they are servicing their debts with defaults hovering at all time lows around 1-2%. once companies start defaulting on debt and high yield credit spreads start blowing out there should be a concern of equities going seriously negative. i would position in higher quality companies that have a low debt-equity ratio and have lower vol.

&#x200B;

international/emerging markets: this area of the market is obviously troubled. a lot of this has to do with the strengthening dollar as well as the increased political risk from US tariffs on Europe and Asia/pacific. i think in time this area of the market will turn around as the US ease up ands as rates stop rising from the fed and we begin quantitate easing from our central bank.

&#x200B;

a few broad allocation suggestions: get into higher quality equities in the case of a downturn of the market, specifically look at the downside capture of a certain fund/etf. de-risk from high yield credit into investment grade. if you have higher yielding credit, look to switch into floating rate loans which have a lower duration and are senior secured debt in the line of credit. if you seriously think there will be a recession i would look at moving your equity positions into government backed vehicles that have a yield around 3% and wait for the pullback. also finally dont freak out, this is normal market volatility, in the grand scheme of a market cycle you cannot be the fearful investor.",0.94,"['Good to read a post like this instead of the usual ""buy MU or EA because it has to go up""', '[deleted]', '>government backed vehicles that have a yield around 3%\n\nIs this currently available to retail investors?', ""Honestly, I think nothing would've happened if not for trade war fears.\n\nIt's true we're in a rising rate environment, but the economy is going pretty strong. Earnings on the whole are incredibly strong.\n\nThat said, I don't think we'll grind up again until more certainty is found in trade."", '[deleted]', 'These are good advice and observations.

I encourage you to take a closer look at how close to the bankruptcies the small caps are."", 'Two questions relating to your observations and their application to present circumstances. First, regarding rising rates and allocation of funds within fixed income. What are your thoughts on using something like a barbell strategy, splitting funds between short (< 2 year) and longer (7-9 year) term debt (using something like Bulletshares), as opposed to simply allocating to fund or portfolio that has greater exposure to debt in the intermediate (3-5 year) term range?\n\nThat dovetails a bit with my second question corporate debt defaults. A large swath of the riskier corporate leveraged loans outstanding were made, and continue to be made, on a ""covenant light"" basis. This has greatly reduced the incidence of ""technical"" (non-payment) defaults. As a result, and thanks in part to continued economic expansion, many of the least credit-worthy borrowers won\'t default or be forced to restructure their debt until the principal on those loans comes due. The leading edge of the most recent (post-crisis) wave of leveraged loans will start coming due in 2019, with more and more in aggregate principal coming due over the ensuing couple of years.\n\nWhat are your views (or what are you hearing) about when or at what point (in terms of amount maturing, prevailing rates, anything else) borrowers on those maturing leveraged loans will have difficulty obtaining refinancing (or extending and pretending) in light of higher (and likely rising) interest rates as compared to when the loans were made 5-7 years prior?', 'this dude mix up many facts and cant justify his conclusion. I found this thread no value at all. \n\n""this is normal market volatility""\n\nI dont think any experts now can really saying this is normal market volatility or not. If it fall below Feb\'s low, then it is not normal. otherwise, maybe.\n\nI dont find it normal however, I cant say how not normal it is. Still monitoring the implications. \n\n', 'I’m very curious about the emerging market equity play on quantitative easing vs the rising rate environment thesis in credit.

DE11-21,9zs2gf,asset allocation vs market timing,1543007085.0,6,0," I'm interested to hear opinions on this one.  


I've read from many sources that asset allocations should be based on your propensity for risk, time horizon, goals, investor behavior, etc. Once set, asset allocations do not seem to change except for age and significant changes in investment goals). I've also read that it is impossible to time the market.  


My question is regarding changes in asset allocation over time. Conventionally, bonds should be favoured as one nears retirement age. But what if the investors propensity for risk changes based on the economic or business cycle. Or if an investors asset allocation varies over time for reasons other than age?  


For me personally, I find I am at max pessimism at when markets are at all time highs, and max optimism when markets are low.  Or to say another way I am naturally contrarian.  Theoretically, this would have me favor a higher fixed income allocation when in the late stages of the business cycle and favor equity allocations after market corrections/recessions. To wit, these days I find I am marginally (and becoming more) positive about forward returns given that many equity markets are at (or near) correction territory....having said that, prior to 2018, I have generally been leary of equity markets as they do not seem to present much forward opportunity.   


So, how do I reconcile this? Is this strategy/approach market timing and should it be shunned? Or are asset allocation targets flexible enough to account for changes in risk propensity based on the macro-economic environment (or ones view of the macro economic environment)? For what it's worth, I think such an approach requires somewhat firm rules and a clear policy.  


Or...is all this crazy and just reflective of an investor who doesn't really know themselves yet? Would such an investor actually be a de-facto conservative investor in denial?   


I realize that asset allocation is somewhat non-scientific in general and is a very soft skill in terms of how to evaluate...I also realize that saying you can handle a bear market is much different than actually handling a bear market....so all this leads me to believe that asset allocation can in fact be used to address an investors cyclical risk propensity.  
",0.5,"['It is really hard to time the market. Certainly a lot of fee-based financial advisors do a lot of what you are describing. They will have an economist on staff who is doing elaborate forecasts, and try to go “defensive” when they fear the market is overpriced.  In my view, the main reason they do this is that it is easier to defend that strategy to a client. Clients tend to get more angry over losses than they get excited over returns. So they err on avoiding grumpy customers who may tire of paying their fees in a declining market.\n\nThe main argument against trying to do the market timing is that over long periods of time, the stock market tends to perform quite well. But, I saw a study that said if you were out of the market for 10 specific days, you would have missed most of the gains over the last 30 years.  When the market spikes up, you want to be in.\n\nSo maybe the happy medium is to come up with an allocation that lets you sleep comfortably at night. If the market is near a high, you may find that your equity funds have drifted higher than your target allocation. So it is a good time to rebalance back to the target.  But if you feel the need to rebalance beyond the target, it may be a sign that you are more risk averse than your current target.\n\nPersonally, I was convinced that we were headed for a crash with the huge deficit increase that Trump and the Congress promised. But if I had acted on that, I would have missed out on two years of spectacular gains. In the past couple of months, the market seems to be nervous about the huge deficits. But if I had tried to time it, I would have lost out on huge gains.   I don’t know how long the current downturn will last, but if the fixed income allocation gets to be too high, then that is the time to rebalance again and buy some more equities.\n\nThis is all assuming you have a long time horizon.', ""Benjamin Graham himself believed in dynamic asset allocation of the sort you describe. Of course you want to be heavy in stocks when no one else wants them and vice-versa. Buying stocks blindly based on age as opposed to valuation is total nonsense. There's very little risk in buying a basket of cheap stocks.\n\nBen also suggested a minimum of 25% and maximum of 75% for equity allocation. This has more to do with emotional discipline. ""]"
COL11-26,9xet1g,Is there such thing as hedging career risk with your investments?,1542312816.0,15,0,"Background: I am a 26 year old 3rd year law student, no debt, and have 290k in my Roth IRA. I have been doing well in the market during law school. I was up 74% in 2017 and am up 45% YTD in 2018. 

I am going to go work for a top notch law firm in NYC in about a year that pretty much exclusively does finance. All of its client are big banks, hedge funds, private equity firms, etc. 

Once I start there in Oct 2019, I will have major trading restrictions such as notification the firm prior to trading to check for conflicts, 6 month holding period on equities, etc. I'll be making 200k a year before taxes and COL in NYC. I'll be able to roll 20k of the 401k plan (post tax dollars) into my Roth IRA. 

Would it be prudent as an investor to short or buy puts in XLF? This would be to hedge my career risk of working for a firm that only does finance and which business booms when Wall St booms. 

Also I'm not looking forward to having trading restrictions. One of the things I like about trading/investing is that you can bail out of an investment if you find out that you are wrong/change your mind.

Did you invest in something that had crazy gains? \n\nRegarding your other questions. Don't do anything tricky because of your new restrictions. Just buy low fee ETF's like Vanguard with your high salary and ride that into the sunset IMO. You should be able to retire early unless you squander it all or have a lot of lifestyle creep."", ""Congrats on the job. Do not short XLF in an attempt to hedge the prospect of losing your job because of a slowdown in finance.\n\nYes, slowdowns in finance happen. Yes, this has a dramatic effect on deal flow in banking and finance practice groups at NYC firms. But, for the most part, firms like those you're describing (including those with disproportionately large finance practices, like Cahill) are loathe to terminate even way-underutilized or underperforming junior associates before the end of their second year, and often for at least another year after that. You do not have the financial wherewithal to short the finance sector for that length of time in an amount meaningful enough to hedge against long term (1+ years) unemployment. And you have no need to do so as a hedge against short term unemployment.\n\nIf you are going to get pushed out of your firm, whether for economic reasons or otherwise, you will almost certainly have months of advance warning (albeit indirectly, because law firms generally have poor people management practices, so pay attention to what's going on if there's a big slowdown). And if it's non-performance based layoff (or you're pushed out due to being up-or-outed, which doesn't usually start happening until the end of at least your third year) it would likely come with a severance package of at least three months, even for very junior associates.\n\nMoreover, there is some cachet in the legal industry to having worked at firms like that in NYC. And, prior to your fourth year or so, you won't be so hyperspecialized that you couldn't find a job in a different transactional practice, either in NYC, where there is a lot of job churn at that level, or elsewhere.\n\nSo do not take a short position against the sector comprising your firm's primary clients. That is not a good idea, financially or otherwise.\n\nAnd don't screw around with those trading restrictions, either. Your firm takes those seriously.

COO12-06,a4esl5,The case for Altria (MO),1544304601.0,35,34,"With the volatility we've been seeing in the market lately, I think there's some good opportunities to deploy some cash. My portfolio and watch list consists of blue chip dividend stocks (with the exception of BRK.B). The two most compelling buys I find right now are BRK.B and MO.

Here are the reasons I believe MO is a bargain right now

* Forward PE \~ 12.5, EV/EBITDA \~ 11.3
* Yield \~ 5.9% (on average it's around 4.5%)
* Solid balance sheet. Debt/EBITDA \~ 1.30 (Anything less than 2.5 is considered pretty safe).
* Interest coverage ratio \~ 14.35 which tells me the quality of their debt is pretty good.
* Return on invested capital consistently above 30% (S&P averages 13%).
* Management expects EPS growth (and subsequently dividend growth) of around 7-9% for the next two years. Due to the inelastic nature of tobacco and the Marlboro brand name, MO has significant pricing power. Cigarettes in the US are still pretty cheap compared to the rest of the western world ([https://www.statista.com/chart/15293/price-for-cigarettes-per-country/](https://www.statista.com/chart/15293/price-for-cigarettes-per-country/)). This combined with low capex spending and solid cash flows make for a high yield and a consistently growing dividend.
* The new CEO (former COO), Howard Willard, has played a key role in previous large acquisitions such as John Middleton and US Smokeless Tobacco. Both acquisitions have turned out to be smart choices by management.
* MO is well diversified. In addition to cigarettes, they sell cigars, smokeless tobacco products, wine, own a 10% equity stake in BUD (single largest brewer in the world) and have just shown they will be moving into marijuana as well. They can afford to pay for their stake in CRON with cash outright (Approx $2.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet).
* Their recent announcement of discontinuing their e-vapor products tells me they are expecting either FDA approval for IQOS, an equity stake in JUUL (their balance sheet gives them enough room to take on some debt) or possibly both.

Declining cigarette use and the risk of FDA regulation is often cited as a reason to avoid investing in MO. I believe their strong balance sheet, diversified sources of revenue, strong pricing power, shrewd/shareholder friendly management and opportunities for growth in alcohol, reduced risk products and marijuana will continue to generate profits for shareholders in the long run. On a more speculative level, seeing the consolidation amongst other tobacco players (BTI acquisition of RAI), there's a chance MO and PM might recombine at some point in the future. At its current valuation, I believe MO is a strong buy.

I respect the fact that a lot of people have moral and ethical reasons for avoiding a direct investment in tobacco. This was meant to highlight MO purely from an investment point of view.

Go pickup Juul at a discounted rate as their viability has been all but shattered (and you failed in the vapor space already), squeeze out any profit you can from them, get in on the early stages of corporate marijuana involvement, utilize Juul as a way to maximize marijuana vapor in the future. This doesn’t even mention the core business + potential of iQOS. Also, the possibility of PM rolling MO back in (all though the FDA again makes that look less likely than it did before, yet not impossible)\n\nOverall, I feel much better about the prospects of MO in this space than a BAT.

ORCL12-17,a7yf3l,The Videogamization of our Markets,1545315989.0,7,0,"The Videogamization of our Markets was one of the most obvious signs of its Destruction. 

While the Central Banks crushed Volatility, forcing original thinking into Submission, the Bots got smarter and the Game of earnings got more predictable...
Given that $21T+ of QE was sloshing through Markets a a unidirectional Bid, it became quite clear that markets would go up over time. 

Passive money helped grease the wheels, so Company Management became quite adept at the Game:

1) Tell “The Street” what your “Guidance” is so they can set their Models. (Make sure to make this very simple so it can be programmed into basic Sell-side Excel models but also read by OCR engines in Programmed Bots). 

2) Make this “Guidance” low enough to be “Beatable”.

3) Be sure to keep the “Sell-side” models updated with your IR department talking to the “Analysts” throughout the Quarter. 

4) Be sure to “Buyback” enough stock to increase your EPS enough to “Beat” the “growth” forecast. 

5) “Announce the Earnings Beat!” Each quarter.

6) Repeat

There are literally thousands of examples of this Game being played over the last Decade but even yesterday $ORCL demonstrated it flawlessly. In a Quarter where revenues were flat and cash flows declined, they showed “EPS growth” due to buybacks, and they “Beat the Street.”
This Game of Earnings is only one small part of the overall Videogamization of Wall Street over the last Decade. 
Much more pronounced is the Intra-day, Intra-week, daily movements of securities.
Given the collapse in Volatility and the Unidirectional nature of Markets over the last Decade, it became simplistic to program Bots to trade within this range. 

Why would you need a Human mind for this type of environment?
The only Strategies that worked were ones that were long-biased and followed the metrics of the Earnings Game as well as the Markets Always Go Higher Lie of the Myth of Passive Investing which was kept propped up by the Myth of Infallible Central Banks.
These Strategies could be coded in a very simplistic way. Thus, they were and the short term movements of securities thus became relatively predictable. They would trend up, follow the Earnings Game and the Rules of the Myth of Passive Magic. 

Unsurprisingly “Quants” thrived.
“Quants” is another name for “Simple Bots” they observe the behavior of securities operating within the Bounds of a System driven by The Earnings Game and the Myth of Passive Magic, while controlled by the Myth of the Infallible Central Banks.
Said differently:

If you crush Volatility and dispersion and force a certain limited set of parameters onto a market by eliminating the Volatility of many Factors, all you have to do is control those Factors and you can come up with solutions for the remaining variables.
By Faking like Risk doesn’t Exist,
Central Banks bounded The Game of Markets in such a way that The Myth of Passive Magic had enough power to ensure there would be enough Capital simply playing along with The Earnings Game...

But we shouldn’t ignore the: Central Banks Releasing Statements to tell everyone How the Game would be Played part of the last Decade. 
This became an important element because it ensured that The Game could go on. 
As long as the Words in the Release didn’t change: Keep Playing!
So all the while, Coding was getting easier, conformity was increasing, the Myth of Passive Magic was gaining steam and the Bots were growing in influence and the Companies were learning how to comply with The Earnings Game and Wall Street was cooperating. It was going great!

2017 was the Pinnacle of this Videogamization of the Markets. 

During 2017, the S&P 500 had a Sharpe Ratio of 3.7 and the VIX remained under 20 all year long. There were a record number of days below 1% movement in the S&P. The Videogame was easy! The Bots thrived!
What is so remarkable about this is the Myth of Passive Magic should have been a tell that things weren’t making much sense. The basic premise is:

Don’t do anything because markets are so Easy you don’t need to do anything!

Investing is Easy and should be Free!

Go Passive!

Now of course there is some Truth to the Myth of Passive Magic: the Lie of shitty active management has been a source of value destruction historically and it is True that Beta should be close to free in time. BUT, the Myth is that Passive Magic will always work...
The Fundamental Error of the Myth of Passive Magic is the same error of the Myth of the Infallible Central Banks only more explicit. Passive Magic assumes if you markets will always go up. 

The Myth of the Infallible Central Banks assumes they can make that happen.
Given that these two Myths are of course a Lie, it can begin to become clear what is wrong with the Videogamization of the Markets:

In Fake Years that Should Never Exist like 2017, the Videogamization works great! Passive Magic thrives. Bots thrive. Idiot Strategies work!
It is no coincidence that 2017 also featured the literal creation of a Videogamed Market called Crypto which was a 24/7 global Day-traded Digital Currency Complex made for the Videogamed Society of our time...

This was a Natural Reflection of the Markets. A microcosm...
Alas, as we know:

The Myth of Passive Magic is a Lie. 

The Myth of the Infallible Central Banks is a Lie. 

2017 was a blow off top of absurd denial about the Fact that Risk Exists. 

2018 was the beginning of a return of Normalcy and Risk to Markets. 

The Videogame got harder.

What we are witnessing this year and will continue to witness next year is the Losing of the Videogame by simplistic Bots and Idiot Strategies that were built for the environment of the last Decade which was Fake. 

Markets are in Reality quite complex, Risky and hard to predict.
The Earnings Game itself has been a charade that has been able to be maintained in some sense but now that the Actual Economy is slowing down, particularly in China where the Fake System is being revealed, the companies are struggling to keep it up.
Now that Volatility is re-emerging in Markets the simplistic Intra-Day, Intra-week and other short-term patterns which were so simple to predict by simple Bots aren’t so simple anymore. “Quant” just got harder than it looked because Markets are Normal not Fake again.

Now that Risk is being reflected in the System and Central Banks will soon be revealed to be Fallible, the bounds of the Game will be healthily shattered. 

The Videogame will Break. 

But of course we knew that would happen...
Reality is way too complex to make into a Videogame. Global Markets are far more dynamic and complicated than the Myth of Passive Magic allows for: they can go Up and yes they can even go Down. Way down for a long long time. 

Anything is possible in Global Markets and economies.
Now that we are entering a more Normal time, the Delusion is not only wearing off for the People. It also is for the Bots and others who believed the Videogamization could continue. 

Unfortunately, it has Infected our Markets rather deeply so the Humans now watch the Bots fight.
But alas, the Humans can still look at the $ORCL Earnings release and call bullshit on the Video Game if they want. 

The great thing about Reason being revealed is that Humans can finally participate in Markets again.
Now that Reason is returning and the Markets are becoming more Normal, the Humans should really have a lot more to do. Like think about what might happen if Markets don’t just go up, up, up. 
Like if the Central Banks can’t just control everything...

Like what if Risk Exists?

The Videogamization will of course always be with us in someways. 

But way the Future will be much more about Cyborgs than Bots. 

It will be more about Risk and Reality than simple Myths. 

Markets will be Hard again.

Furthermore, I couldn't find this article, since it was in my Reuters platform, but here it is;

***Whose Is That Big Pile Of Corporate Debt In The Corner?***

*The Fed's more hawkish than expected tone has triggered a selloff across markets. There's a growing feeling that further tightening of financial conditions is bad news for equity markets but also credit markets which are already looking risky.*

*TS Lombard note this morning that spreads have risen across investment-grade and high-yield debt in Europe and the U.S., reflecting ""****concerns about the high level of U.S. corporate debt and its deteriorating quality****."" One important issue is where that* ***lower-quality debt is actually held****, writes Man Group.*

*""As we head towards the end of the credit cycle, we feel it is important to consider* ***exactly who owns the $3.4 trillion of sub investment-grade corporate debt****,"" analysts at the hedge fund write.*

*That's the equivalent of Germany's GDP last year.*

*Of total sub investment-grade corporate debt, $1.1 trillion is owned by banks with the rest ($2.3 trillion) held by asset managers and institutional owners.*

*Though Man Group says they don't traditionally think of asset managers as a systemic risk, they say liquidity could dry up if sub-investment grade corporate debt drops in value.*

*Moving on down the chain of debt-derivative products, they advise investors to hone in on* ***collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) used to tranche and sell sub-IG debt****.*

*As you can see below, some of these are held by unspecified ""other investors"", according to a breakdown by the Bank of England cited by Man Group.*

*""With very little visibility in this part of the CLO market, how this ""****black hole****"" will react in the event of a downturn remains to be seen,"" the analysts conclude, ominously.*  


I posted this since I regularly see writers at this sub stating that it is buying time and that the downturns are primarily driven by mass-psychology, since the falls of October ensued.  


*(I'll see if I can find a post I wrote in October on this subject-matter, as it had some extraordinary excellent articles that expanded on this topic. If I'll find that post, it'll be posted in a separate post in this thread\*).*  


It is my opinion that this isn't the case and has been very clear right from the start, with explanatory factors relating to the increasing corporate debt sectors as major risk-factors.

I believe the ensuing yield-curve inversion is a reflection of these realizations, and that the current geopolitical battle between the U.S and China in terms of the trade-war, won't have a positive impact *even* ***if*** there is a mutually beneficial trade-deal between the U.S. and China.  


If there'd be a deal, there'd be a ""***sell the news***"" event, since it would be overshadowed by other factors trumping that initial stint of optimism.  


If we see a severe deterioration in debt-servicing by companies and fundamental indicators in the U.S. such as corporate profits declining and interest rates rising further we're going to see this spreading to Europe too via the derivatives exposures of banks.  


It is furthermore a matter of time before wages start eating into corporate profits in the U.S. as demonstrated by the record-lows of unemployment, which is an additional burdening factor coupled with rising interest costs.  


Personally, I have only traded short positions ever since the ViX began its ascent since October this year, due to these underlying factors.  


I believe this will escalate further, and we'll see continuing drops until at least Q2 of 2019, and thus continue shorting.

The answer to your question depends on how long your willing to hold. Next 6 months? You might lose money. Holding for a few years? You\'ll most likely make above average returns imo.\n\nA few reasons this is a hard value stock today:\n\n\\- Forget stock price for a moment and let\'s look at the financial statements. As a CPA, former auditor for public companies, and as a value investor, I value financial statements over stock prices when making investments. At the peak before it\'s last downturn, at 35$/share, it\'s market cap was 40$ billion but MU only had 12.5$ billion of equity (Q1 2015). Today, about only 3 years later, MU has equity of 35$ billion, almost triple at it\'s peak before it\'s last crash, and is at 31-32$, trading nearly at book value. Heck, even if you had bought MU at it\'s peak stock price before it crashed in 2015, you\'d still have a good investment on your hands today, from an equity point of view. The point is that MU is a business with strong growth over the medium and long term.\n\n\\- Will RAM demand slow down in the long term? I think the obvious answer is no.\n\n\\- Will margins be permanently low in the long term? Probably not. New RAM tech comes out and prices rise again.\n\n\\- Is this crash different from last time? Some would argue that this time there\'s much less competitors in the market and this will help margins from going negative. I\'m starting to buy this theory as MU just released ""terrible"" guidance, announcing ""only"" 2 billion dollars of expected net income next quarter. It only has to tough it out another 3-4-5 quarters until RAM prices increase again, and if MU\'s so-called survival mode during this low period generates 2 billion of net income, I\'m very, very comfortable with that. I\'m comfortable with a quarter of that actually.\n\n\\- Does MU face big competition from Chinese stealing intellectual property? Anyone\'s guess. But every time new RAM tech comes out, the Chinese have to re-steal it again. Not to mention the Chinese would have to form a company that can continuously reinvest 8-10 billion /year in R&D to be on top of their game with Samsung and Micron.\n\n\\- Have u seen the market downturn in the indexes recently? Many industrials and S&P 500 companies are down 20% in the past 2 months. MU has shed about 25-ish percent over the past 2 months from it\'s low 40s. Interesting to note that MU\'s recent decline during the correction/bear market is similar to fortune 500 companies.', ""Don't own MU and my knowledge regarding MU and semi firms is exclusively osmosis since MU is talked about so often on the investing subreddits. Here goes:\n\nMU has been involved in IP wars with Chinese semi firms. Chinese firms have attempted to appropriate IP from MU and China's gov't allows this. Also, the Chinese will at some point in time come online with their own semiconductors and will begin taking market share. Also, NAND/DRAM are forecast to become cheap in the future due to not only cyclical trends but anticipation of Chinese glut.

So, fundamentally the stock is valued at a ridiculously low level (P/E about 3, p/b 1.3). Even the most bearish analysts aren't expecting EPS to drop too much in the next trough, even if it halved or more, the stock would still be cheap at these valuations.
