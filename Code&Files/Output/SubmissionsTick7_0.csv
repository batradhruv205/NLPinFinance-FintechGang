The key for insurance companies is solid underwriting, a good investment portfolio, and staying clear of getting greedy. \n\nI have to agree with daveyfck1, Berkshire owns some really solid insurance companies that have turned an underwriting profit most years. Other than Geico, they mostly deal with long-tail insurance which are the policies that are unlikely for example, insurance on a doctors practice that covers them against malpractice. \n\nWhen it comes to their investment portfolio, it is all operated by the man himself Mr. Buffett.

WFC04-13,8b0n07,This is the week for gains in the financial sector. DD inside. (x-post to r/wsb),1523297810.0,1,0,"TL;DR: I think there is strong possibility of strong gains to be had this week in the financial sector. Buy in by COB Wednesday to take advantage, and exploit using $XLF options or $FAS.

Thesis: The financial sector is one of the most undervalued in the market right now, and as earnings season begins I expect the market to finally give the sector the attention it deserves. Reasons:

1. The financial sector is tremendously undervalued right now when you [simply look at ratios](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true). At 18.3, the financial sector currently has a P/E ratio that is not only the lowest in the S&P 500, but [is in line with historical P/E ratios](http://www.multpl.com/), unlike many sectors right now. 
2. Earnings should be strong for a couple reasons. One of these reasons is that net interest margins, the difference between the interest a bank pays and the interest it receives, [has been expanding](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/jpmorgan-citigroup-wells-fargo-and-pnc-financial-are-part-of-zacks-earnings-preview-cm945379), possibly more than analysts have been expecting.
3. Another reason to expect strong earnings is strong economic fundamentals. The market has had ADHD recently with concerns about tariffs, $FB data usage, Trump tweets about $AMZN, and so on. Investors have lost sight of the fact that the economy is pretty strong right now, but earnings season will remind them of that. We have great job numbers, rising household incomes, high consumer confidence, and so on. These are conditions that lead to high use of the financial sector among both consumers and industry.
4. Another reason for strong earnings is this is the first quarter of earnings after tax reform. Enough said.
5. FAANG may finally be becoming passe. I realize as I am typing this that $NFLX is up 3.5% today (though on low volume) even though it has a P/E ratio around 232, but the market seems a bit more skittish around tech ever since the Cambridge Analytica news came out. Retail investors are being dumb and buying the bubble, but [big investors are very short on tech right now](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/04/09/hedge-funds-turn-bearish-on-tech-giants/).

More importantly, one year forward P/E ratios for these are respectively: 12.65, 17.49, 10.72, 13.08, 18.87, 12.27, 14.04, and 11.14. These valuations are as close as you can get to a steal in this market.



How to exploit:

1. Trade $XLF. It's a high volume ETF that tracks the financial sector of the S&P 500. Of the banks announcing earnings this week, its holdings include $C, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC. I would expect good results among these banks to raise share prices among the rest of the holdings of $XLF. Simply buying $XLF is the safe play.
2. Buy calls in $XLF. Pretty straightforward.
3. Buy $FAS.This is a 3x leveraged ETF tracking the financial sector. It tracks all of the banks announcing earnings this week, among others. It has average volume of around 2.3 million shares per day at a price of around $65, so it's big enough that liquidity won't be an issue. This is what I'm doing.
4. Buy calls in $FAS. This is only for those who play Russian roulette for fun. DON'T DO THIS.

For any of these methods, I would buy in the next couple days. With today's gains, I feel like there are decent odds of a pullback. Look for buying opportunities.

PNC04-13,8azuz6,Money market funds now paying 1.75%+ interest,1523292041.0,78,138,"Banks have been very slow to increase interest on savings accounts. Many large banks still have the nerve to pay no interest. A quick check shows that in my zip code, BoA, PNC, and Wells Fargo each pay 0.01% to 0.03% interest on their basic savings accounts. If you jump through hoops by having a checking account with them and meeting account minimums, hopefully avoiding the $5-$12 account service fee, they pay a whopping 0.06%, 0.10%, and 0.32% interest, respectively. Even bank money market savings accounts pay very little interest, at 0.03% with PNC Bank. Unless you're with an online bank like Ally, a credit union, or another bank that is particularly aggressive about their savings account interest rate, you're probably getting ripped off.

Vanguard's prime money market fund pays 1.74% interest currently with no account service fee, although given, it does require a minimum of $3000 to start. But if you already have investments with vanguard or another mutual fund company, it's a no brainier to use their money market fund as your savings account rather than your bank savings account. I keep a $100 cash buffer in my checking account, credit cards for emergencies, and then my savings are in Vanguard's prime money market fund beside my taxable investment and retirement accounts.

I just wanted to point this out since it feels like increasing mutual fund money market rates have flown under the radar. It's kind of upsetting to me because I feel like people are getting robbed. Meanwhile, mutual fund money market accounts could be paying 2.5% interest by year end, with essentially no risk to principal.

On another note, does this change anyone's investment strategy? I'm thinking that retail investors, seeing saving account rates go up alongside increasing market volatility, may reallocate more into cash, pushing markets down further.",0.91,"['So there is some *slight* risk involved in MMFs compared to a savings account.\n\nFor one, they are not FDIC insured so if the fund goes belly up you\'re hosed.\n\nSecond, there\'s an extremely rare phenomenon called ""[Breaking the Buck](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breaking-the-buck.asp)"" wherein the fund\'s NAV falls below $1.

> PG&E Corp. has been losing customers in tony Marin County north of San Francisco since 2010 to a new kind of rival, and says their growing popularity is costing the utility’s remaining customers, to the tune of $180 million last year. That could balloon to $500 million in the early 2020s, according to a statement Tuesday.

> California’s big three utilities are looking for ways to address this emerging issue. They helped make the state a clean-energy leader by striking some of the first big deals to buy wind and solar power. Problem is, those early contracts came with higher prices that were typically locked in for decades, and it’s costing them customers.

> The utilities are facing smaller local suppliers that are signing their own power-purchase deals at current, lower rates, and then siphoning off customers by passing on the discounts. At least 4.5 million California homes and businesses will be getting electricity from them by yearend, according to the California Community Choice Association, which represents these new power companies.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-proposes-reforms-support-160000811.html

> Also in 2002, California’s legislature authorized the formation of CCAs, allowing cities and counties to purchase and/or generate electricity for their residents and businesses. The first CCA began in PG&E’s service area in 2010. Likewise, customers can choose to receive their electricity from other third-party suppliers called Energy Service Providers (ESPs). For both CCA and ESP customers, PG&E continues to deliver the energy and provide meter reading, billing, maintenance and emergency response services.

> Today, communities that choose to implement CCA programs or customers that choose ESPs are responsible for the PCIA charge associated with energy resources procured on their behalf. PG&E does not make any money on the PCIA. The PCIA charge is required to ensure that all customers are treated equally and do not pay for other customers’ share of costs.

> However, the current PCIA formula has become unbalanced over time due to the growth of CCAs. **In 2017, CCA customers only paid approximately 65 percent of the costs associated with the energy resources procured on their behalf. This imbalance required PG&E customers who were not part of a CCA to pay approximately $180 million to subsidize CCA customers. Assuming this trend continues, in the early 2020s this amount is expected to grow to half a billion dollars, which is equal to the current PG&E low-income subsidy.**

TL;DR: The three major utility companies are stuck with old, expensive contracts, and are being undercut by cheaper competitors as a result.

You can have it.\n\nI\'ll say that in the low teens and not far from where it was in 2008, it\'s probably not bad. It\'s not great and it\'s not going to turn overnight (and probably won\'t even ever truly ""turn""; I\'ve been saying for several months now on here that the solution is breaking GE up), but it\'s not going to 0. \n\nThat said, what irks me about these threads is that GE is where GE is for a very legit reason: this was a poorly managed company for a decade and a half. Rot set in while Immelt was there and their solution was to get a new CEO who ... was there during the entire Immelt period. An inspired, dramatic choice to change the company would probably be someone from the outside, not someone who had been at GE since the late 1980\'s. Flannery feels more like the person left to clean up the mess and when he was announced, the market then voted acccordingly for months after. I don\'t know that I\'ve ever seen such a horrible reaction to a new CEO at a large company and that was before people even really turned really negative on what Immelt left (the ""Immelt traveled with an extra plane"" stories, etc) I see 6/12/17 as when Flannery was announced. The stock is -51% since.\n\nGE was about $60ish when Immelt took over, $40 by 2007 and $20 last year. Maybe it\'s just me but that seems like a fairly lengthy trend lower.\n\nThis isn\'t a good company that suddenly became out of favor. They\'re likely to break it up... which Flannery should have done from day one rather than try to turn around the house that Immelt ruined.\n\nEdited: https://www.benzinga.com/news/18/04/11509755/ge-could-be-evaluating-hybrid-deals-ipo-spinoffs\n\n', ""I agree.\n\nLooking at GE in aggregate, it looks bad. But if you look at GE in business segments, the business segments that are expected to do well 10-20 years down the road are doing PHENOMENAL. \n\nI don't have a source (on mobile, sorry) but the industrial segments like power, renewables, have been doing spectacularly well. We're talking like 30% plus YOY growth in those segments. What is dragging them down is consumer segments like lighting which I am guessing they are either going to split up into industrial and consumer and sell off the consumer unit, or sell it altogether but keep the R&D unit and license patents and what not.\n\nThey are slowly transitioning from a conglomerate to an industrial-specific conglomerate. Instead of selling washing machines at $1,000 a pop and having to open up call centers (expenses) to service that business unit, they are building multi-billion power grids for entire countries that will rack up 10's of millions if not hundreds of millions or a few billion in consulting fees (revenue, profit).\n\nIn any transition to completely change the vision of a business, there's going to be collateral damage. Having that collateral damage be weak earnings but with $350 in backlog orders and otherwise decently strong financials... I'll take it.\n\nLong term, its a great investment.

I'm saying that there seems slim chance of it being a major multi-bagger, having already reduced their dividend (again), and with the potential of more accounting problems yet to be uncovered. What are you really hoping for here? For it to get back to 30 from where it is now at 13? In how many years?

Cruising Reddit lying in bed lol.\n\nGE is mainly considered to be a dividend stock. So what happens when you halve the dividend? The stock price halves. What happened the last time before that when they cut the dividend? The price dived as well. So currently, GE has only a few options:\n\n1. Up the dividend. Which it can do, but will probably screw up their restructuring because they kind of need less of a weight around their necks.\n\n2. Keep shedding their businesses. That makes them no longer much of a conglomerate, and more like a tech engineering stock. This is what they're trying to do now. The problem is that they need to reinvest profits possibly even more than they do now, that will continue to tank the stock until all the dividend income people have left the building.\n\n3. What I think they should do: buy back stock. It sort of solves both problems. The cash, when they feel like it instead of being forced to, lowers the available shares, which raises the market price.

Forget about it for 20+ years.\n\nAnd to be honest, that\'s what 90% of canadians will need. \n\nIf you want a little more direct control you can look up the ""canadian couch potato"" portfolio which is also balanced index investing but now YOU have to do all the work of monitoring it and rebalancing.\n\nStay away from whatever products the banks are selling you.

BA04-25,8dwyc3,ETFs/Equities,1524329466.0,7,0,"Thank you for taking the time to read my post and answer my questions. So here is a quick breakdown of my current investment. 

   I currently have a few Investment which include my pension approximately 20k in that account, a deferred compensation plan (437b) through Work that has approximately 6k. My 437b deducts 100$ bi weekly from my check into this account which is diversified into EQ/Large cap value index, EQ 500 index, some small caps, Invesco global real estate fund etc. I plan on increasing it to another $100 every year I make more money. This is a supplemental retirement income separate from my pension that is ran by an advisor that works in my department. It has done really well as I started in 2016 with a small minimum investment. I do not control the allocations in this account.
      I also have 3500$ in which I used to open up a Roth IRA account. I opened it a few years back and was advised to purchase mutual funds via American Funds. It did okay on an original 300$ investment and adding 100$ every month to that account. I recently transferred that money out and put it into a TD Ameritrade Roth IRA. I sold the American funds and bought a couple equities that I use on a daily basis and other stocks I researched that had good cash flow/dividend yields/cash flow positive/ technology in the cloud/ and things I use everyday. Because that’s what I read online to buy stocks that you use everyday. Think I saw that on Mad Money with Jim Cramer one time haha. So the companies I purchased a few shares of $BA, 2 shares of $AAPL, a couple shares of $MSFT a couple shares of $FB, $JPM . Not knowing much, I got clobbered right as the market corrected in early February. Held a few of the stocks and right now I’m down about $300 from that initial $3500 investment. I also just purchased a share of $AMZN at $1374 just for the hell of it. I love amazon and have prime and want to hold this for as long as I’m alive lol. 

So here are my retirement goals. Currently 30 years old with the aspirations to retire in year 2060. I want to minimize my risk in individual equities but also want a decent return on my investment. I would consider myself a moderate to higher risk investor as I am looking for solid return anywhere from 8-16% return year over year. I understand markets fluctuate and that number will fluctuate. 

     So my advisor through work isn’t the most accessible person to get a hold of so my question is how can I minimize my risk during market downturns and also limit my exposure to just individual equities. I have looked into vanguard target retirement 2055 symbol $VFFVX. But they have too much exposure to bonds right now where I feel I could be maximizing my exposure in the equity market. I’ve been looking into ETF such as $VTI $VOO $VWO to give myself a broader exposure to domestic, international and emerging markets. I love tech and aerospace and am interested in ETFs such as &
$QQQ and $ITA $DFEN. I am not a day trader but am investing for a long term buy and hold strategy. ETFs are probably a better long term strategy considering I don’t have a large amount to spread around with individual stocks. After researching ETFs it comes down to expense ratios.

RCL04-26,8e2n9n,4 interesting long opportunities that you should know about,1524395841.0,2,0,"United Rentals (URI), Sabre Corporation (SABR), Criteo (CRTO) and Royal Caribbean (RCL)

**United Rentals** (URI) operates in a cyclical industry with a volatile stock price but with a CAGR of 23% for earnings over the the past 5 years investors have been well rewarded.  Looking ahead the outlook remains bright.  The Purchasing Managers Index at 59% remains very optimistic about future growth.  Thats up from 55% a year ago with any result above 50% being a bullish forward indicator.  Long term trends for the industry are positive as companies realize the significant benefits from renting over ownership.  Additionally, as market leader URI enjoys significant economies of scale but with a market share of just 11% it still has a long runway for growth.  Trading on a multiple of 11 times consensus 2018 earnings it looks cheap. 


**Sabre Corporation** (SABR) is a travel technology company, the biggest service provider for air bookings in North America and connects the worlds leading hotels, car rental brands, rail carriers, cruise lines and tour operator with travel buyers.  That's a fast growing business with significant barriers to entry in the airlines solutions while hospitality is competitive.  The stock has fallen 33% over the past 2 years and trades on a TTM PE of 12.  However, Imperial Capital initiated coverage this week with a target price of $30 representing a 50% increase over Fridays close. With consensus 2020 earnings of $1.91 that looks quite reasonable.


With the stock down 50% and a forward 2018 PE of 12 **Criteo** (CRTO) looks cheap again. The company is a leading advertising company in the digital market space that hit problems last year when Apple blocked it from Safari browser users.  However the company has got over it with Q4 number report sales up 23% and earnings up 30%. With the stock down 50% and a forward 2018 PE of 12 it looks cheap again.

Finally Cruise Lines such as **Royal Caribbean** have had a great run with the stock rising more than threefold and EPS growing by 55% CAGR over the past 5 years.  Numerous tailwinds continue to boost the outlook with an aging population, strong growth in China and tax benefits in the US likely to provide a boost.  Earnings growth is likely to moderate going forward with consensus forecasts suggesting 15% annual growth.  With a 2018 forward PE of 13.6 the stock looks cheap at $119.00.  Stifel Nicolaus recently issued at $152.00 target price citing an expected positive revision to summer and full year guidance.  With reporting expected in the next couple of weeks investors may want to take a look.

I have been looking at Salesforce (CRM) and Hubspot (HUBS). Both companies are in a similar space in technology. They each create CRM software and marketing software. 

If you look at the stock, you might think they are a similarly sized company. Hubspot is currently trading in the $110-$120 range and Salesforce has been trading in the $115-$125 range. 

But if you look at the size of the companies - Salesforce is huge in comparison. Salesforce is a Fortune 500 company with a market cap of $93B and nearly 30k employees. Hubspot is a rising star for sure, but with a market cap of $4B and 2k employees. 

*My primary question is, how are these individual stocks so close in value when the companies are so different in size?*

What the image above doesn't show you is that Salesforce had a stock split a few years ago. I know that must be a factor in how closely they are in value.

The real answer is that **valuation matters**.  Conveniently, Joshua Kennon has already written a great answer to your question in his article, [You Have to Focus on Valuation Metrics in the Stock Market!](https://www.joshuakennon.com/you-have-to-focus-on-valuation-metrics-in-the-stock-market/):\n\n>Had the author paid attention to the latter, it would have been clear that 13 years ago, Microsoft reached $60.00 per share, which represented a price-to-earnings ratio of 85.71.  That was an earnings yield of 1.1%.  In other words, you could have put your money in the bank and earned 6.00% on certificates of deposit at the time with no risk, or taken a lot of risk an bought Microsoft for an earnings yield of 1.1%. Today, in contrast, Microsoft has a p/e ratio of 17.01 and an earnings yield of 5.88%.\n\n>Put another way: For every $1 in profit the company earned in 1999, the market rewarded Microsoft with $85.71 in stock price.  Today, the market is valuing the firm more rationally and giving only $17.01 in stock value for every $1 in earnings.\n\nTo confirm this, I took a quick look at Microsoft's 10-Ks going back to 1997. Other than 2009 and 2016, this company has grown its revenue by impressive amounts every year, **grown its EPS from a split adjusted $0.33 in 1997 to $1.87 in 2008, a robust 17.06% CAGR**, has been throwing off dividends ever since initiating one in 2003, and has been stockpiling cash year after year.  \n\nThe business performance of Microsoft, while not immune from criticism, is absolutely not the reason the stock performed poorly over the time period you mentioned.

MSFT07-19,8zwu79,Why are stocks like AMZN and MSFT down today?,1531930249.0,10,0,"Hi r/investing,

I'm new to investing in general, and have been watching stocks like AMZN, MSFT, BABA for a couple weeks now to try and understand it all.

I noticed that despite nothing but good news about the Amazon Prime Day, the stock is still at ~0.20%. Also, MSFT is down ~0.70% at the time of writing as well.

What confuses me more is that the S&P 500 is up 0.16%, which leads me to think there's something specific with these two stocks, or tech as a whole. But I can't figure out what. 

One thought I had was it was an opportunity for some investors to buy in before the ERs to come. ""Buy the Dip"". Another thought was that a lot of investors are wary of the upcoming ERs and are cashing out their gains before it happens.",0.21,"['Haha, no better sign of a bubble: ‘Why is this stock that just made a new all time high yesterday down a negligible amount today?’\n\nAnswer: because no stock can literally make new ATHs every single day in perpetuity.

You\'re probably thinking ""Ok, sales are doing really well, we should see a lot of people jumping in and buying up Amazon and increasing their share price"".\n\nOn the other side of that perspective, you also have the (speculative) investors that bought into Amazon at the beginning of the month, betting that Amazon would perform well on Prime Day. Chances are that some of those guys are selling their shares off today or in the next few days. If there\'s enough of them selling, as the good ol\' law of supply and demand goes, we have a larger supply than what is being demanded, and the price goes down.', 'Four steps forward, one step back', 'More than likely people taking gains before an $800b market cap company posts earnings.

Not every day's movement is associated with a news story or other event and attempting to assign some sort of reason to every slight move is a fantastic recipe for frustration. Things can become overbought (EDIT: and Amazon is technically overbought: http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=AMZN), there can be a rotation out of a sector, all sorts of things day-to-day. However, trying to assign reasoning to a stock being down 0.25% is a waste of time. \n\nI've owned Amazon for a while now. Do you think that I tried to analyze every 0.25% move lower? Honestly, every 1-2% should not make you think a decision has to be made as to whether or not you should buy or sell something (**and making every 1-2% move somehow meaningful when it's not is a fantastic way to overthink yourself right out of a great long-term investment**) and 0.25% isn't worth the effort to go through posting. That sounds harsh but it isn't meant to be - it's meant to honestly try to focus you on the long-term and not waste time focusing on every little move up and down because really, there's better use of your time IMO.\n\nIf you want to look up news, then go to Google News and type in the name of the company. That's honestly what most people use to answer questions here and it's something everyone can use. But when you're talking about 0.25%, that's just not anything. Stocks don't go up every day until news, stocks and sectors don't all go up together day-to-day. I'd highly recommend stop focusing on the day-to-day and start moving your focus towards 1-3-5 years out and how you want to be positioned - very Gretsky “Skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.”\n\n\n\n"", ""MSFT was at ~103 five days ago and you're asking why it went down .83 today?

FB07-25,908d5y,Zuckerberg's sales of FB stock since 2016,1532024483.0,53,86,"I kept seeing Facebook pop on lists of top insider sales week after week and got curious so I did some digging and I'm sharing here. This is just all of Zuckerberg's insider transactions (they were all sales) since the beginning of 2016. In reality, the dataset goes back to 2012, but he only had two sales before 2016 and it didn't make sense to squeeze the horizontal axis anymore for two data points. 

Anyway, I wanted to see if the privacy issues had anything to do with the dramatic increase in sales recently so I added some annotations of key dates, which I obtained from [this](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/) article. I have two charts:

1. [Number of shares Zuckerberg has sold](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR92E3KFA66LFXmNZE-609pgoJav1Y0m9K-FT5qJKT0JrJei55uUpPS89Id6BuWYNpTYdBFEvPnnS8A/pubchart?oid=1414172733&format=interactive) versus the price of $FB at the time

2. [Value of the shares Zuck has sold](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR92E3KFA66LFXmNZE-609pgoJav1Y0m9K-FT5qJKT0JrJei55uUpPS89Id6BuWYNpTYdBFEvPnnS8A/pubchart?oid=2001634303&format=interactive) versus the price of $FB at the time

Sorry for crappy looking charts, this is the best I could do with Google Sheets. Anyway, it gets the point across. Zuck has sold $4 bln worth of FB stock *this year*, and $6 bln over the last 2.5 years. The value of the stock that was sold is calculated based on the stock price at the time of the sale (e.g. this isn't what his stock would *currently be valued* if he still held it). 

Edit: the price chart looks weird because only the prices on the dates when sales actually took place are accurate. The prices on those days are just connected with straight lines. I could have used points instead but I thought this was easier to visualize.

EA07-26,902ivb,Is Nintendo's slide a buy opportunity? And a look at its competitors.,1531973051.0,30,13,"TL;DR: I saw Nintendo’s slide, so I decided to take a look at them and others. I like Nintendo, but am more skeptical of the others. Thoughts on Nintendo, Activision, EA, and Take Two? If you have anything that may help me improve or understand more, please let me know.

[Data here](https://imgur.com/gallery/yOLUtyo)

I am young and getting into investing, and when I saw that Nintendo has slid over 20% in 3-months, I was surprised. I decided to look into the basic fundamentals of Nintendo and some of its competitors, if only to practice stock research. I decided to look at Nintendo ($NTDOY), Take Two ($TTWO), Electronic Arts ($EA), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Zynga ($ZNGA), Konami ($KNMCY), and Ubisoft ($UBSFY) (Nintendo, Konami, and Ubisoft are international companies, so I listed, and mainly looked at, their ADRs). I also chose to ignore Sony and Microsoft because both of these companies are very diversified beyond video games, so I thought that it might skew the data, even though Nintendo directly competes against PS4 and Xbox.

For each company, I looked at their P/E Ratio, Current Ratio, and Debt / Equity Ratio. Then I averaged each number, weighted by market cap. I found that for each of these metrics, Nintendo looks good based on P/E Ratio and Current Ratio, although its Debt/Equity is high compared to its competitors. It seems to me that Nintendo is acting more aggressively than others, but that is less concerning considering how liquid they are. The average Current ratio is 2.64, and none of the companies fall below 1, which is comforting.

These are my thoughts after looking at this information and the 3 month & 1 year returns of each company:

I am surprised at Nintendo’s performance, as they seem very healthy and I don’t see any red flags on the numbers side. News wise, I can only assume that the slide is based people seeing a relatively weak E3 and a light holiday games lineup (though, with Smash and Pokemon, I’m not sure I agree with that). I see a successful new console, and I imagine they will continue to be very successful in the coming. In addition, according to MarketWatch, this year’s estimated earnings in $2.04 vs $1.24 last year. Looks like a buy to me.

For all of the other companies, I am surprised that they have all considerably outperformed the market. It has been a good year for video games according to sources like the NPD group, but seeing high P/E ratios, especially ATVI at 180+, is scary to me. On the games side, ATVI can lean on tentpoles like Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch, but I think that there is a real possibility that the new Call of Duty could fall short. I am not bullish on ATVI. For TTWO, I fully expect Red Dead 2 to do incredibly, but its release is definitely going to be a big swing for them. 2k games seem to be shaky, but will probably still perform well. GTA5 seemly can’t stop selling, as well. I think EA is in a similar boat with its EA Sports offerings, and Battlefield V should do better than Battlefront 2 did last year. These companies all seem poised to succeed, but I don’t know how long they can continue to climb like this.

That’s all I got for this. I really enjoyed doing this research and trying to understand it. Do you agree that Nintendo is a buy? Thoughts on ATVI, EA, TTWO, and the others? Again, I’m still new at this, so I would love to hear comments and critiques, I’d love to improve. What do you think?

LEG07-26,90h4ay,"Here is my words of wisdom after reading Peter Lynch’s, One Upon Wall Street a couple-times.",1532101858.0,26,95,"*Misspelled the book title in the post so my apologies*

**One Up on Wall Street**

Here is all that I’ve digested in the past from reading Chapters 1-15 of Peter Lynch’s, One Up on Wall Street. It’s very dry cut but it has helped me out and I believe it can help newer investors!

**Words of Wisdom Chapters 1-15**

Stay away from DiWORSEification. Make sure a company isn’t investing into things it doesn’t understand. Find companies that focus on what they’re good at (niche).

You know stuff before the Wall Street investors. Possible stock purchases are in front of you. Look around and pay attention to your surroundings. Look locally. Try products. Get a taste when you can. Know people in industries and ask them what’s selling or doing well. Ask friends and family. 

It’s good to have the institutional ownership at a lower number rather than a higher number. As Acquirers Multiple would say, be different, Zig when others Zag. 

Just because a company works in one state, doesn’t mean it will work somewhere else. Sometimes waiting to see if their growth will be the same on more of a national level isn’t a bad idea at all. 

The investors relations office isn’t just for the pros. Get questions ready and studied, then make a call to the company you’re interested in buying. Two good questions. If unsure the good question always is, “What are the positives this year and what are negatives?”

Look at current assets and take the cash figure and add it-to the marginal securities. This gives you the total overall cash position. Socking away money is a sign of prosperity. 

Check the debt. Lowering debt is also a sign of prosperity. When cash is increasing and debt is decreasing is what we want. Our cash - debt is our NET cash position. 

It’s important to know what each product means to the company. How much of their profits come from this product? 

You want a PE ratio that’s half the growth rate. This is good. PE at twice growth rate is very negative. (PEG =<1)

Debt determines the survivability of a company. There’s two types. Bank debt and funded debt. Bank is worse because it’s due on demand. Bank debt is due sooner, also he can ask for it whenever he sees trouble. Funded is best debt. As long as interest is being paid, the business can’t be forced to immediately repay it.  

Dividend paying is good! Companies that don’t pay dividends can waste money on diWORSEification. Dividends create a positive aura. It also stops stocks from falling as much if they didn’t have a dividend during downturns. 

Lower debt is still more important than dividend paying. 

Book value understates or overstates actual value because a company realistically won’t be able to sell assets for as much as balance sheets show. But remember that the debt in the sheets will always, always beed to be paid. 

There can be hidden assets such as assets not being projected by interest gain. Company might buy gold at $500 five years ago. Now it’s worth $700. They will still show it on balance sheets as $500. That’s a hidden asset. 

Cash flow is amount of money in result of doing business. Look for companies that don’t need to spend as much cash to stay competitive. Cash flow needs to be looked at ‘free cash flow’ for this reason. 

You don’t want inventory buildup. Inventory growing faster than sales is a bad sign. Two types of inventory reports on balance sheets. LIFO AND FIFO ( last in first out. First in first out )

Growth is not synonymous with expansion.  Earnings is the most important metric for growth. 

Recheck companies story every couple months. 3 phases of a growth company. Startup phase, rapid expansion ,and mature phase (saturation phase)

First phase is riskiest, Where stock is growing and finding its ground. Second phase is when they are really performing. This is where you make most money) third phase is when the company needs to innovate to keep making more money.

Example is $ADR , the beer company. They own over 40% of beer market. They are a phase 3 business. They must find innovation. 

**FINAL CHECKLIST:**

P/E needs to be compared at industry level. Is it lower or higher? 

Institutional ownership preferably low!

Insider buys and buybacks are positive signs!

Are their earnings consistent?

What is their debt to equity ratio?

What’s their free cash position?

Have dividends always been paid and routinely raised?

If you’re holding long term make sure to check long term growth rate and how they do during market declines and recessions. 

Cyclical companies you must pay attention to the inventory levels to gauge what part of cycle they are in. 

Check for fast growers that their supposed enriching product is a big part of their actual business. Example is Hanes had a supper popular leggings company. Unfortunately it was a small part of their full product range!

Check to see if a company has room to grow. How does the PE ratio compare to the earnings growth?

Do they have enough cash to come out positive in a liquidation?

Big companies make small moves. Small companies make big moves. Look for smaller companies that are already profitable and have a proven concept. 

Stay out of ‘hot’ stocks in hot industries. Invest in out of favor, dull mundane companies. 

The ideal investments are companies with niches. Moderate fast grower with 20-25% growth are ideal investments. 

When checking depressed stocks. Look for ones with superior financial situations. Stay away from ones with a lot of debt. 

Look for companies that consistently buy back their own shares. Insider buying is a positive sign. 

A watched stock never boils!

Spend more time or as much time looking for a stock as you would for your own refrigerator

FIS07-31,92vf8z,Virtual Reality Companies,1532877190.0,18,5,"I have a bit of a weird question and I apologize if this is the incorrect subreddit for this.  


For you to understand the question I have to give you a very quick backstory and explain my situation.

Almost 2 years ago, I got a new job that I very much enjoy and have started making a bit more money than I recently did. 

I've been trying for once in my life to get smart about finances so I made out a plan, started budgeting, read multiple books, and even got a financial planner.  To skim over everything, for the first time in my life I'm feeling like I might actually be safe and stable for a while. I'm very frugal in most ways, I pay off my credit card debt, mortgage and car payments have never been missed and I have a good credit score.

But for the first time with a bit of disposable income, I wanted to do two things: get healthy and set aside a fund of money for ""riskier"" investments, as a sort of hobby. I have done minor stuff here and there, generally been mostly basically broke even, maybe an occasional profit but nothing serious. But I'm always watching stuff and reading about them almost out of curiosity. Like a little game or challenge to see if your assessment and predictions become true or not.

So to get healthy I bought a HTC Vive. I heard you move around a bunch, I enjoy gaming, and I loved Sci-Fi movies and books and always thought the idea of VR was cool but it's been disappointing every time I've tried it. So again to skim over, I'm fully on board with this technology. It's fucking insane how much you move. There are some games that I literally can't play for more then 20-30 minutes. I added wrist weights to add to it and I mean it feels like a full on, better than usual workouts at a gym. Both cardio and muscle. It's finally here. It's not the end version, it's a couple off, but it's a couple years, not decades. I keep equating it to my brother this way:

Remember when we got a Nintendo 64 for Christmas when we were kids and it was like one the greatest thing ever at the time? We couldn't BELIEVE the graphics and gameplay of Mario 64. You look at that now, compared to graphics we see today, and it's laughable how simple they are. I feel like the Vive and Rift are the N64 version of VR so within 5-10 years, people are going to go HOLY SHIT, virtual reality is incredible. And it's not just gaming. They have educational experiences. You can do simulators to get over phobias. There are social functions like communities where hang out and chat. I played ping pong with a dude from Bangladash for like 30 minutes the other day, just bullshitting.   


So. To my question.

I am in no way wealthy, but I feel  secure enough that I'm trying to figure out if there's anyway to actually put in some money  into a technology that I believe is going to be literally one of those rare ""game changer"" technologies. I just can't fucking figure out how to do it. I mean would it be just investing into some stocks of companies like HTC? How can someone, completely on the outside, try to simply financially back a concept like VR but not a specific company per se? I'm just trying to figure out the most reasonable, rational, way that an every day Joe with a fair amount of research but for sure not an MBA or anything can try to take a chance?  


Any suggestions would be greatly greatly appreciated. Honestly even something like ""take out a loan and hire people to start making VR games or open a VR gymnasium"".  


And I also do understand that there are LOADS of news articles talking about how unsuccessful VR is or how the companies are this or that. I understand those may be true now, I'm just saying I am buying on the fact that I trust my judgement of the technology as a concept and the future of it, not a SPECIFIC company",0.78,"['Spread it around do any emerging VR companies you see... Facebook, HTC, content creators like DIS, etc.', ""VR gaming is too specific to invest in directly (yet) with little capital; your best bet is to invest in large gaming company or more-so chip-makers. I don't believe VR will dominate for well over a decade personally, as while it's incredible it's not impeccable and easily enjoyed by everyone unconditionally. Wait for the VR specific companies planning on full-VR even beyond gaming to come, that's where small fishes will be able to make money investing in VR.\n\nTo compare it, it's the same with space-tech. You can't invest in it with little money, even millions, you can invest in related companies however, but truth be told the day the first asteroid or other planet harvester is launched, years and years from now, you will have the chance to literally over 100x your money as the bubble inflates screamingly. But till then the best you can do is sit on your hands and wait, just as I thought of myself doing spitting on gas cars since I was a little boy.

O08-01,93d1e3,Basic Question: how to calculate Implied Rate?,1533030006.0,3,3,"Hi guys,

I am looking to improve my understanding on bonds, in particular - gilts.

Several questions if I may, based on [investing.com website data](https://uk.investing.com/rates-bonds/uk-government-bonds):

1. Why is 1M, 3M, 6M is not updated live? - is that because there are no bonds maturing or are they just not traded..? Seems to be only at 7am...
2. This [image](https://a.c-dn.net/b/2fJbfd/GBPUSD-May-Fall-Bank-of-England-Set-for-Dovish-UK-Rate-Rise_body_UKrateprobability0.png) from yesterday's [news article](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/07/30/GBPUSD-May-Fall-Bank-of-England-Set-for-Dovish-UK-Rate-Rise.html) shows (same as above?) figure of implied rate and has (a calculated?) implied BP. I understand that Implied BP is effectively 0.716% out of 0.75% possible and thus 84% probability of a 0.25% hike, but how exactly is 0.6706 is converted to be 0.716%?
3. From 1M bonds [here](https://uk.investing.com/rates-bonds/uk-1-month-bond-yield), how can I calculate that Implied BP rate..? The bond matures on 20 Aug, so I assume it has X days on 0.5% rate (until BoE decision) plus Y days on 0.716% rate (discounted from 0.75 as not completely certain). I've tried to reverse-calculate, but just cannot figure it out. Any ideas how to do it?

Thanks and sorry for basic questions, trying to get my head round these!",0.72,"[""Hi,\n\nI don't know the answer to all your questions, but will try to help where I can:\n\n1) Your 1M, 3M & 6M curve points will be derived from the yield of UKT bills - my guess is they aren't very liquid and hence the rate stays pretty static over a day in most cases.\n\n2) Your second image shows step dates - dates at which the BOE will meet an decide on a potential interest rate rise (or cut). These are generally used to build swaps curves. Your swap curve will not be the same as your bond yield curve.\n\nWith regards to how these numbers are linked - I am just looking at this for the first time myself - you correctly noticed that a 84.42% chance of a 0.25% hike gives us an expected value of 0.21605%, which I guess is the 21.60bp displayed. Why this only makes the implied rate 0.6707 and not 0.71605 I don't know, maybe someone more knowledgeable can comment on this? It's possible that the 21.6 bp is added over the overnight and not the BOE base rate to get that value.\n\n3) I don't really understand what you are trying to do here - you are mixing up concepts from the Swap and Bond curves which doesn't quite make sense. \n\nHope this helps somewhat.\n""]"

PSA08-01,91sa99,Peugeot SA (PSA) surges after record earnings,1532528726.0,1,3,"They took over Opel from GM recently. GM lost 17 billion USD on Opel over 17 years, but PSA manages to make Opel profitable (0.5 billion) within a year.

Very impressive work by CEO Tavares, the guy used to work under Carlos Ghosn for a long time, having a certain rivalry and some of the same strategy.

Personally I don't really believe in PSA, they have no serious alternative fuel portfolio made public, little presence in growing SEA car markets, and are invested heavily in diesel, which is being phased out rapidly. On the plus side they are strong in China and Europe, and have serious plans to expand in India and the North American market. Still a risky investment, but potential for much bigger gains than most other car stocks.

Higher costs and lower crop yields would be distributed very unevenly, while higher grain prices would be distributed more evenly.  So if you actually had some insight into climate change, you could win big on grain prices, by buying into the agricultural businesses that won\'t be hit with higher cost and lower yield.

For most people at least.\n\nYou also probably have the option of allocating a certain percentage towards different funds, for instance 70% target date and 30% aggresive, but for now just do the target date until you feel more familiar with everything. \n\nFor what it's worth, I did something similar to the 70/30 for my 401k, and I have a Roth that I use for picking and choosing individual stocks and indexes."", 'Your enrollment form should have come with some sort of magazine or brochure type informational. There should be either a breakdown or pie charts of how each fund is vested. Check with HR if they didn’t provide this information to you, it will help to know which fund works best for you.\n', 'Each fund has an ""expense ratio"".  In most plans each fund has a symbol, such as the fund I chose in my 401K has the symbol VINIX.  \n  \nIf you post symbols (rather than names) of funds you have questions about, we can give much more accurate answers. (But probably they hide the symbols to make comparisons harder).   \n  \nIn my opinion, your best choice is the one among the funds that are 100% equities (no bonds nor fixed income etc.) with lowest expense ratio.  In most plans that is an S&P500 index fund.  But not always.  \n  \nABA has nasty expense ratios and (for the type of fund it is and the minimal management it actually requires) that ""2060 Retirement Date Fund"" is particularity nasty.  In some ABA plans the ""**Large Cap Index Equity Fund**"" is the best among all the bad choices, but it isn\'t very good. (That probably is your best choice, but I don\'t know exactly what your choices are).\n  \nSince the fund selection is not good, you should put in exactly the amount needed for full match and no more.  \n  \nI expect the ""self directed"" choice has prohibitive fees for lower wage employees.  It may be the best choice for well paid top management (if that company has such) because the effective cost of those fees is reduced both by having a larger contribution per year and expecting to stay with the company for decades rather than just years.  But I would be amazed if the fees for self directed don\'t make it entirely a non choice for your situation.\n  \n']"

NFLX10-16,9nnz4x,Netflix -NFLX,1539377433.0,45,8,"When I look at Netflix I see a company burning money on Netflix originals with limited success.
Netflix lost its core model that I think kept many users around, it was place to watch shows you missed on TV or catch up. Netflix has moved aggressively towards Netflix originals which I just do not feel will work out with them in the long run.

I see a company that of course has a stable user base and is making strides internationally, but has been top dog in a specific market with lower levels of competition. 

I think that when AT&T, Disney and Walmart release their streaming networks Netflix will see real competition and content will become more expensive with more bidders.

Not to mention the pure amount of content a company like Disney and even AT&T (Time Warner Cable) has to offer. Will people look for other options besides Netflix or is Netflix something people will always have a subscription too. That is a question up for debate, but in my opinion it has to hurt.

I would love to be proven wrong as I am here to learn, I just feels like it is sitting a bit high and soon the market will be flooded with options for consumers. ",0.66,"['Netflix’s core model was completely unsustainable. It was a commodity product. When they started facing competition from other streaming services it was the 100% right move to expand from content distribution to content creation.  The only way they can compete is by offering original content that people want.', ""Netflix is a content creator now just like Disney, HBO, Amazon and even Hulu etc.  For better or worse I think you'll start seeing every major and minor studio creating their own streaming services and keeping their content in house so regardless of business models, I think Netflix has to sink or swim with original content.  With that said, I think Netflix is right up there with Disney and HBO in terms of quality and quantity.  Netflix also has a huge international market now which doesn't hurt.  I do think ultimately Disney comes out a head once their service is up.  If you look at box office for movies all anyone cares about is Marvel and Star Wars these days.  Disney owns all of those back catalogs and will keep making more including new exclusive original content for streaming like the new live action Star Wars series.  Disney can also package more into a subscription like park and Disney store discounts for example in a similar way that Amazon does with Prime.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've had a Netflix subscription since the days before streaming existed and I hardly use it anymore.  I feel like their original content is overly saturated right now.  There was a time when there was like one new show coming out per month or one every few months and now it seems like there is a hundred new original series/movies per month and 90% is garbage like everything else and I am too overwhelmed to sort through everything when I launch the app to find something good.  "", ""Netflix has a great advantage with their interface.  It's one everyone is used to since they were early to market, and it's bright and engaging.  My 10 year old can navigate it and stay in his lane, as opposed to when I let him watch Sesame Street on HBO and came back later to find him watching soft core porn.\n\nWe have Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Now that we pay specifically for, and we get Hulu and Showtime bundled with our student Spotify account.  We'll move in and out of the HBO subscription depending on what we want to binge, and I imagine it will be the same with the other services when they come out.  We'll have them for a limited time and then cancel and watch something else for a while.  However, we'll always have Netflix for the kids and 90% of the time if something is streaming in our house it's a Netflix show.\n\nAt some point, I think there will be a move by Netflix competitors to keep you from cancelling their subscription, whether it be a cheaper yearly option or by limiting how many weeks of back episodes you can watch.  They are still stuck in the cable model.\n\nI know I'm not the market, but thought I'd give you one family's perspective.  I think it's a Hold, but I'm waiting to Buy."", ""Their goal now is to basically be HBO NOW, yet they're valued 10x what HBO as a whole is. "", 'You guys think this is a good hold for long term? Bought some recently and kinda regret it.', 'Netflix is in a good position to take on competition. I’d see it slowing their growth, but not stifling it. It’s not like the only way for them to make money is with a monopoly.  \n\nYou might also consider buying into Roku, as they stand to benefit from the rising competition, regardless of who does well.', 'I wanted to add one variable to this discussion that is normally overlooked. Most of the time, everyone talks about 1) price 2) Disney / other streaming services entering the market and 3) original Netflix shows and their quality (or perceived lack thereof). Since those are pretty vetted out in this and other threads, I will leave them alone...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe variable that I wanted to mention is the question of technology superiority. Netflix is in FANG for good reason. Their tech is incredible. They have been studying user behavior and tailoring UI and search to keep you hooked. Suggested for you, the subconscious submersion in their UI, etc. -- it all is backed by data and \\*very\\* well considered. If you check out the ""Business Wars"" podcast on Netflix vs Blockbuster this will impress you. Unknown to most, Blockbuster did try and pivot and compete with Netflix on streaming. They even slammed their prices and had the temporary competitive advantage of supplementation with brick and mortar stores. Despite those advantages -- and literally copying the website design of Netflix \\*exactly\\* -- they still couldn\'t compete because their tech couldn\'t hold water compared to Netflix. I think the tech barrier is the most important thing to watch with Netflix valuation versus competition going forward. Disney\'s (and the others) success will depend on it IMO. ', ""I see Netflix dominating streaming in the short and long term. Their original content is pretty damn good. One of their biggest strengths is that they don't have ads and everything is free. Amazon is not like that and neither is Hulu, two of it's biggest competitors. Another one is the selection of movies, e.g. Jurassic Park, Dark Knight, etc. It's light years ahead of any other streaming service in content and ease of use. \n\nIt is spending like crazy and it needs users to grow its revenue. The one thing I don't know and may be integral to their success is international user growth. "", '[deleted]']"
NFLX10-16,9n31xf,Introducing the White Girl Index,1539202369.0,627,3684,"I talked about the idea [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9mvabs/z/e7htx2q), and it's a simple one, but potentially lucrative. All that needs to be done is identify public companies with major product lines enjoyed particularly by basic white girls and equal weight them. Intuitively it makes sense; these are customers with money and the ability to set cultural trends. Here is the American white girl index as I currently have it:

* AAPL

* DECK

* DIS

* EL

* FB

* LB

* LULU

* NKE

* SBUX

* UAA

* ULTA

* VFC

If we add foreign stocks, we can include these:

* ADDYY

* DEO

* LRLCY

* LVMUY

I don't remember the rest of what we came up with, but regardless, backtest and behold. White girls crush the market.

EDIT: I'm back in this thread, and I agree about several of the proposed additions, most notably TIF. A lot of you are asking why I left out SNAP, though. I simply forgot about it, but even if I didn't, it's been public for such a short time that it would screw up any decent backtest, and I would probably not include a company with no history of positive EPS anyways. That said, if any of you put some money into a scheme like this, feel free to add or subtract whatever you want. I am powerless to stop you.

EDIT2: In accordance with community consensus, we can go ahead and add these:

* ETSY

* FIZZ

* GOOS

* NFLX

* SNAP

* TGT

* TIF

Why can't you touch this money?

I'm sure most of you will say BRK so you must have at least 5 stocks and at most 10.

Dividends if any will be automatically reinvested into the payer, no re-balancing, no touching of the account after your initial purchase no matter what happens.

This fall has also pushed a number of my positions that were up a lot into flat or even net losses, and I've been wanting to rotate some out of tech as I'm way over weight there.

Do I sell some of those tech positions now that they are at a loss and move them to some of the more stable positions I was hoping to get into?

Do I keep the cash sitting - obviously no one can predict the bottom etc etc etc, so do I just bite and enter on this dip with half of the cash on the sidelines?

-TRBCX

-JNJ

-V

- DO i add more to the tech stocks I had, I mean a lot fo the gains were wiped out: ADBE, ROKU,  AMZN, GOOG, FB (FANG looking attractive), and what do i do with SQuare [ave in 76 - buy more?]?

-suggestions? Also what do you guys think about Macy's? I dind't realize they are giving a 4.7% dividend [It wasn't even on my radar until I saw some lengthy discussion about it last night. They do have great RE holdings but arent monetizing it very well, still not really truely looking to add just thought I'd ask]


edit: My goal is to rotate into some value stocks b/c I'm too heavy tech and growth

",0.5,"['1. I\'m not buying any more Square into this. Very upset that Sarah Friar left to become CEO of Nextdoor. Dorsey was ridiculous not to make her CEO and be Chairman. Her leaving (and the announcement was totally abrupt) really throws things into question a little. This is a person that has basically acted as the CEO and the face of the company; she\'s been the one talking up the company and for her to just suddenly up and leave for a smaller social media site is not a positive sign. And you know what? I may be wrong and it may just go back up near the highs again before long. However, when someone that important to a company leaves in that manner I have to be cautious because someone talking up a company like that just deciding to go head some social media site makes me think that the Square opportunity was perhaps no longer as compelling, at least in comparison. She\'s on the board of Walmart; if this was her leaving for a role at something giant like Walmart then I\'d be maybe a little more understanding.\n\n2. ""Also what do you guys think about Macy\'s?"" Macy\'s has turned things around, but I would *not* buy something because of the dividend. Take the dividend away, do you like the business? If not, then no. People could have also pointed to Bed Bath and Beyond having a decent dividend for a while now. Meanwhile, the stock is currently below 2008 lows. What\'s the dividend done for those shareholders? That was what like $80 a few years ago?\n\n3. ROKU and ADBE are appealing IMO as long-term holdings. I really don\'t want to own FB and GOOGL has not lived up to expectations in a while; the idea that they didn\'t tell about the breach recently because they were worried about reputation and regulatory scrutiny. I think have concerns - moreso with Facebook than Google - that these companies are not appreciating the mood in regards to privacy and the possibility that regulation could appear. Facebook is also just totally tone deaf putting out that smart home camera. AMZN still like very much as a long-term holding.\n\n4. V and MA are good. I\'d rather ABT in terms of boring healthcare plays than JNJ.\n\n5. Nobody can predict the bottom. However, when you look at late January and stocks were as overbought as they have been in like 2 decades, it was a time to be cautious. When stocks become as oversold as they were in February and were yesterday, there is at least a reasonably solid chance that you\'re close to at least a short-term bottom. There may be a retest at some point. I think you have to have a long-term view and allocate in a way that fits your risk tolerance.', ""Why does everyone want to sell the loss? It makes no sense?

KEY10-18,9o9w1u,Sears files for bankruptcy,1539581074.0,638,3674,"Per CNBC - After years of [Sears Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SHLD) staying afloat through financial maneuvering and relying on billions of CEO Eddie Lampert's own money, the 125-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy.

The filing comes more than a decade after Lampert merged Sears and Kmart, hoping that forging together the two struggling discounters would create a more formidable competitor.

It comes after Lampert [shed assets and spun out real estate](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/eddie-lampert-says-sears-is-shrinking-shedding-assets-to-stay-alive.html), all to pay down the debt the retailer accumulated when that plan went askew. The company still has roughly 700 stores, which have at times been barren, unstocked by vendors who have lost their trust. Many of the stores have never been visited by a generation of shoppers that can barely recall it was once the the country's biggest retailer.

Lampert, who has a controlling ownership stake in Sears, personally holds some 31 percent of the retailer's shares outstanding, according to FactSet. His hedge fund ESL Investments owns about 19 percent.

Ultimately, it was a $134 million payment that did the company in. The company had a payment due Monday it had not the money to pay.

Other forces were at play too. Sears' creditors refused to agree to a [restructuring proposal](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/sears-ceo-proposes-restructuring-plan-to-avoid-bankruptcy.html). They had little assurance by way of collateral or strategy, after years upon years in which Sears' only shot at survival came by selling off parts of its business. Over 42 quarters, only one yielded positive same-store sales growth. As of late September, Sears tallied $5.6 billion in current debt.

Its board was in a perilous spot. Its special committee was tasked with approving Lampert's other plan, [a bid to buy his storied Kenmore appliance business and other brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/eddie-lamperts-hedge-fund-esl-proposes-to-buy-kenmore-brand-sears-real-estate.html). Approving his offer would have helped Sears make its payment. But it would also thrust the board the spotlight, potentially opening them to the threat of litigation from shareholders who might allege Lampert has stripped the business bare.

#### Homes to Hardware

That business was once a giant. It started with Richard Sears, [who launched the Sears Watch Co. in 1886](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html) to sell watches by mail. The company later evolved into Sears, Roebuck and Co., which sold everything from homes to hardware through a catalog. The convenience brought its products to America's most rural locations.

In 1925, Sears morphed a mail-order plant on Chicago's West Side into its first retail store. By the end of the year. Sears opened seven more stores. Eventually, Sears became the largest U.S. retailer, and its house brands like Kenmore and Craftsman earned spots as staples in homes across the country. Generations of children marked the holidays by paging through its holiday catalog, known as the ""Wishbook,"" wondering if they would receive any of the toys inside.

As Sears success grew, so did its empire. It moved into Chicago's iconic Sears Tower, and for a time, owned financial services businesses like Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group.

But [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) topped Sears as the biggest U.S. retailer in 1990. Its efforts to attract female shoppers by showing them the ""softer side of Sears"" and move into new businesses lines left it without a identity.

Those challenges didn't stop Lampert, the hedge fund manager who had already impressed Wall Street with his acumen when he seemingly turned around Kmart, which he bought in 2004. He acquired and combined Sears with Kmart in 2005, arguing that two ailing retailers were stronger together than apart. The financial guru saw valuable real estate, customers he could parlay from one store to the other and ample costs to cut.

The retail giant he created had a market capitalization north of $20 billion in 2006. The media began to wonder whether he was the ""next Warren Buffett."" Lampert could have sold off his investments then, but stayed on, steadfast in his vision of the combined retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) kept opening stores, as did [Lowe's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LOW)and [Home Depot](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HD). Walmart touted its ""everyday low prices,"" while Target served up ""cheap chic."" Lowe's and Home Depot provided a wider array of home improvement products for all kinds of projects, making it tough for Kenmore and Craftsman to compete.

Then, came a double blow.

Consumer spending slowed during the Great Recession, especially for big-ticket items like washers and dryers. Cash-strapped shoppers began using the internet to hunt down the best deals. Gradually, they began to spend more online and avoid the mall, fueling Amazon's rise. Sears' 140,000-square-foot stores began to seem monstrous as foot traffic declined.

Walmart and others began to invest in their businesses to compete with Amazon, but Sears never had that chance. It simply didn't have the funds.

Sears' last profitable year was in 2010. A thinning cash flow has left little money to put back into the company itself, letting it become more irrelevant. For the past five years, the ratio of Sears' capital expenditures to sales has been less than one percent. That's even as its sales have more than halved in the same time period.

Sears has been in survival mode for more than a decade. Unable to rely on the Sears' business to pay the bills, [Lampert instead sold or spun off many of its most valuable stores and brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html).

Since its merger with Kmart, Sears has spun off its Lands' End clothing brand, sold the Craftsman tool brand to [Stanley Black & Decker](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/) and closed hundreds of stores. It spun out 250 of its best properties into real estate investment trust offshoot known as [Seritage](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SRG).

Its key vendors, wary of Sears' future, [demanded tighter payment terms](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/08/sears-same-store-sales-q3-2017.html). Some, like Whirlpool, [stopped shipping all-together.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/sears-cuts-ties-with-whirlpool-and-will-stop-selling-its-appliances.html)

It has been grappling with a pension of roughly 100,000 retirees that, as of January 2018, was underfunded by $1.5 billion, according FactSet.

It became a guessing game among analysts and onlookers whether each of Sears' last five holiday seasons would be its last. But Lampert kept surprising them, extending a lifeline in the form of loans from his hedge fund ESL Investments, or finding them elsewhere, each time bankruptcy looked inevitable.

Lampert, though, sounded the alarm in a Sept. 13 [blog post](https://blog.searsholdings.com/eddie-lampert/update-on-our-transformation/). He pleaded for Sears' creditor's to agree to restructure, calling out the risks should they drag their feet.

""We continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern, rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value,"" he wrote.

By early October, it became evident that Sears' last Christmas before bankruptcy had already passed. Sears began to [raise emergency financing to support the business through coming filing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/sears-arranges-financing-for-a-potential-bankruptcy.html).

Now, the question will be whether Sears will be able to come out of bankruptcy. [Retailers don't have a great track record of emerging](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/here-are-the-retailers-that-have-filed-for-bankruptcy-so-far-this-year.html). Several of late, like Toys R Us and department store Bon-Ton, have been forced to liquidate.

Our numbers at the time showed we were losing nearly $1 million a year on comforters (of all things). Where were they placed? Right next to the large mall entrance farthest away from our camera room. Even if we did manage to see them select and conceal it, the chance of grabbing them once they left the store was minimal. To top it all off, the back corner of the section was a blind spot, so even if the did walk in without it then leave with it, our policy for stopping shoplifters said we needed to have the selection and concealment on camera and we couldn't do anything about it without dancing on the line. \n\nThe biggest thing that didn't make sense to me was we were discouraged to stop shoplifters that stole anything worth $20 or less. I can tell you that unless the person got wild, this was a majority of what we saw. Granted, a necklace worth $15 is nothing compared to other big ticket items, but when you see 3 or 4 a day? Guess what, you're losing money. And that report we wrote that concluded with 'no stop made' was rarely looked into, deemed not worth it. \n\nMy point of view on Sears is definitely more from the bottom than the investors at the top, but I feel like even if the creditors did want to restructure, they would still need to completely overhaul their physical set up and their asset protection department.

LEG10-25,9pkhbm,History’s Longest Bull Market About to Crash?,1539960354.0,51,0,"  

David Rosenberg thinks this bull market is a sham.

In his [Wednesday interview with CNBC’s “Trading Nation,”](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/23/longest-bull-market-on-record-is-cracking-bear-david-rosenberg-warns.html) he warned that this record-breaking bull market (it’s the longest in history as of August) paired with the weakest economic expansion of all time has only been possible thanks to the flood of cheap money from central banks. 

He’s predicting that first we’ll see pain in the corporate bond market, where rising rates will put severe pressure on a handful of companies that turn out to be the canaries in the coal mine for what’s ahead.

And he’s not alone.

Last month, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Michael Hartnett proclaimed the “Great Bull” market is over – and he also blamed rising rates.

Of course, with a record 3,453 days without a 20% correction, this market can’t keep making history forever. 

We all know there will be a reckoning – but when?

One thing to keep in mind is that staying out of the markets can actually be more expensive than staying in.

Say it’s January 1999 and you have $10,000 to invest.

But it’s a scary time to be pondering an entry into markets. The Dow is up 25% from last year alone. Since three years ago, it’s up an amazing 111%.

So you’re too late, right? Grab a bull by the horns and you’ll end up gored?

Not so simple. From January 1999 to January 2000, the Dow returned another 25%. A simple index fund, even at that late stage of the bull market, would have turned your $10,000 into $12,500.

Of course, a handful of companies did a lot better in the last leg of that bull market.

Just think – from January 1999 – 2000, Qualcomm returned an amazing 2,487%. Even Apple, which was mired in a disastrous turnaround in the late ‘90s, nearly tripled investors’ money from 1999-2000.

If you’d looked at the toppish-seeming markets, and took a pass on putting your $10,000 into them – you could have lost a lot more than $10,000, just by forfeiting potential upside.

Of course, hindsight is 20/20 as the cliché goes.

But the parallels between today’s markets and the Dot.com mania are hard to ignore – both the lessons on risk AND reward. 

And even if you disagree with [this analyst that a stock market “Melt Up” is just beginning to ramp up ](https://orders.stansberryresearch.com/chain?cid=MKT376375&eid=MKT385086&encryptedSnaid=&snaid=&step=start#AST90728) \-- you can’t deny that 2018’s biggest winners so far (tech stocks are leading the charge, with Netflix alone up 68% for the year so far) look a lot like 1999’s tech-heavy list of frontrunners that multiplied investors’ money back then, too.

Again – the bull market has to end. But it doesn’t have to end tomorrow, or even 18 months from now.

And in the meantime, who do you think will look smarter when it’s over? People who got out today… or people who ramped up their tech investments (and keep risk management like trailing stops in mind) – while they ride their winners into the sunset like it’s 1999?

1) The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful

2) Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its  always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually  cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months  there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler  data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.  

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom.

WU11-01,9rdme3,"I'm only 29 years old, i'm no expert, but I have a legitimate question i'm hoping the Reddit community can help address about housing bubbles in markets outside the US.",1540496887.0,32,5,"Economics Question. 

If a housing bubble existing in the USA collapsed international markets in 2008, would a housing bubble occurring in Asia, Australia, Europe and New Zealand collapse international markets in the near future? 

Why do I ask?

When I visited China last month, I learned that an apartment in Beijing and Shanghai costs $10,000 USD per sq. ft. Yeah, whoah! Not only this, but the inflation rate is so high that investing in real estate wouldn't have paid off. Would be nice to have someone validate this. 

When in Qingdao, I witnessed a decades worth of infrastructure and I can't put this observation into words.... 11km tunnel, 15 mile bridge and modern buildings 25 times the size of Hartford constructed within 10 years to accommodate a population that significantly overpowers US residents. 

I have an economics professor staying with my wife and I via our AirBnB this week. Naturally inclined to learn more about his work, I read 2 of his articles: 

1) Article on housing prices from 2015 (Take a look at the figure on Page 17): [http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/qfeng/FengWu\_20150206.pdf](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/qfeng/FengWu_20150206.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1ZA3jesxIyTk5A0STEBmkVuuRRh8tbVi7SjK6xerSSdebn7VhAjM4_wK4)

2) Article on China's rapid growth in infrastructure from 2018: [http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/qfeng/FengWu20180423paper.pdf](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/qfeng/FengWu20180423paper.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2UEMhWseIRLOH5P44OCcpl1GfrB3hwHkeKPd7UZjg1SyiSBHECeQpJvGw)

If a housing bubble exists in asian markets and the system collapses...will this will have greater impact on international trade (especially on the US market) at a time when interest rates are rising and trade wars are developing. 

My wife, who is Kiwi, has seen her family home increase 10x in the last decade. 

Housing prices are not increasing significantly in the US and company earnings are still positive, but something tells me that the threat lies elsewhere. 

I'd love some feedback and comments if this interests anyone reading. ",0.58,"[""To say that the housing bubble bursting in 2k8 collapsed international markets simplifies things by a whole bunch. There was an extremely large market around that housing bubble full of derivatives, insurance, and other financial instruments that are far too complicated to explain in a reddit comment. I'd recommend watching *Inside Job* for a comprehensive look at it (if you haven't already). But the housing bubble was a card in a larger house of cards (pun not intended), and it's collapse was one card that caused the rest of the house to come tumbling down, which is what we saw in 2k8.\n\nIs it the same for Asia and Oceania? Perhaps.\n\n> If a housing bubble exists in asian markets \n\nThat's a big if. There's no question, I think, that part of the price increase in the area is driven by normal things like inflation, demand, improved infrastructure, etc. How much/what portion? Hard to say. \n\n> and the system collapses\n\nWhich system? It's a significant question.\n\n> will this will have greater impact on international trade (especially on the US market) at a time when interest rates are rising and trade wars are developing.\n\nIf a bubble exists, and said bubble bursts, it will of course have an impact on international trade. Any significant bubble bursting will have an impact. \n\n> Housing prices are not increasing significantly in the US and company earnings are still positive\n\nThe housing situation in the USA is (potentially) a very different situation. There are factors in the housing situation in the USA that explain the lack of significant increase in housing. For instance, the amount of student debt many in the USA carry is extremely high. This causes many younger consumers to avoid taking on more debt in the form of a mortgage. There are many signs that, while the economy as a whole seems to have recovered, the average American has not seen a significant improvement in their financial situation from between the aftermath of the recession and today.

[This article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/12/business/the-next-recession-financial-crisis.html) might be an interesting read for you. \n\nI realize that this comment has likely not really helped you all that much, but the long story short is - if such a bubble exists and pops (which it's not clear that it is a bubble), there will most definitely be an effect. How serious of an effect is difficult to determine, though I am comfortable saying that my personal opinion is that it's extremely unlikely to be as severe as what happened in 2008... unless, of course, it's significantly exacerbated by other events at approximately the same time.

The average real estate price (new construction) in Shanghai is about 900 USD per sq ft. Of course if you only want to buy the ultra-luxurious, then I am sure they can charge you higher.

Real estate price fluctuates based on may factors, and it is usually local. You can't just look at the most expensive areas then believe it is the case everywhere.\n\n[China's inflation rate is rather low](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/inflation-cpi), also below world average. It remains to be one of the lowest cost of living countries, despite all the economic development inthe past 20 years. Of course if you only shop in expensive stores, you pay a premium.

It also required systematically important shadow banks with very low capital ratios, buying too much exposure to risky mortgages, which were misrated and mispriced, along with bad risk models that didn't account for housing prices to fall in unison across the country, and very loose lending standards. I don't know if any of these are the case in china right now or to what extent, but they were able to observe our crash and learn from it.  \n\nI don't think a housing crash in china would affect developed markets much, at least compared to the US one.  \nIf you want to study some more housing bubble history, look into the japan bubble.  \n\nI doubt real estate investing in Beijing and Shanghai underperformed inflation. Maybe just the rental income portion?"", ""Chinas financial markets are pretty isolated compared to other more developed and freer markets such as the U.S. and the E.U. etc.\n\nIts isolation is due to the fact that very stringent regulations exist on foreign-ownership of assets in the country, which means that domino-effects and asset losses in case of a deflationary period would be limited to domestic Chinese enterprises/institutions.\n\n2008 and its severity was because a lot of debt was restructurized (*CDOs)* and sold on to banks, ***all*** over the world, and was believed to be at the time of high credit quality - AAA.\n\nWhen the housing markets collapsed, these CDOs (*among other assets, but lets keep this example pedagogical)* fell in value, and the amount of leverage, ***some,*** institutions employed magnified the losses of these CDOs which caused their assets to diminish on their balance sheets.\n\nIt became a self-reinforcing cycle, since the debt that they already owned, was leveraged, which caused that basically everyone was in-debted to everyone via interbank mechanisms (*UBS loaned money from Goldman, which in turn loaned money from BoA etc, in order to finance purchases and leverage their books),* had to start ***selling*** their assets to cover the loans that were started to be called in panic.\n\n(*Some signs* ***today*** *are pointing towards* ***real*** *concern to* ***corporate debt being*** *a bomb, and that is one of the additional reasons we're seeing sell-offs happening, a long with the trade-war).*\n\nChina, well, it is almost impossible for individual investors to even ***own*** stocks, and even bigger globally systemically important banks to own assets there, which limits the impact of a debt crisis there and its impact and spread across the globe.\n\nThat doesn't mean though that a debt-crisis would not effect Chinese society, it would, but the extent to which that would happen would be severely limited as Chinas financial system is almost unequivocally in the hands of the government, which means that they can absorb losses on a completely different scale due to their different incentivized role compared to private banks.\n\nI've been to China myself, and can attest to the unfathomable development that they have, but they still have pretty high annualized GDP growth if you look year-to-year, which means that some of what you see is within the parameters of normality, since they're still growing organically.\n\n[https://tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-growth-annual](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-growth-annual)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"", 'It does seem like the Chinese real estate market is held together with chewing gum and duct tape but if it were to collapse it wouldn’t have the same effect on foreign markets. If anything it’d drive more Chinese investors into real estate out of the country. ', 'A correction in China’s housing bubble will significantly slow new building starts in China which could cause lower commodity prices.  So countries like Canada and Australia that have economy’s that export a lot of commodities would be effected.  Also lower commodity prices could be deflationary.', ""Any financial crisis in China will likely have no direct effect on anywhere else in the world. China's financial system is largely closed to the outside world, foreigners hold no financial claims on China. I don't think the next crisis will be like 1998 for China but, internationally, it is the same thing. For example, Turkey is far more significant because some European banks hold pretty sizeable exposures there.\n\nHowever, two side points: One, Chinese citizens have begun trying to take their money out of China. Because China's financial system is closed, banks don't have to pay market interest, and this leads to money either going into property (it is also why China has so many investment scams) or trying to leave the country. It has gone into places like Australia, NZ, and Canada (and other places). This has driven up housing prices, which has driven up household debt, and no-one really knows how it will end. \n\nFor reference: US household debt to GDP topped out at ~100% in 2007 and is now slightly under 80%. Canada's household debt to GDP is ~100%, Australia is 120%, and New Zealand is 92%. Also, in all of these countries, afaik, there are a small number of very big banks. This makes resolving a crisis easier, potentially, but it will also likely mean that the cost will be very large. There is no way that housing prices can ever be allowed to fall (the consequences of inter-generational wealth transfer here are huge...if your parents don't own property in these countries, you will be likely be poor when you die and so will your children). This isn't all China's fault, there are few linkages outside of the regions concerned afaik but it will be pretty ugly all the same (I am guessing all of these nations have a crisis and then slowly stagnate under the weight of their debt, as in the UK).\n\nTwo, China's financial system is closed but it is obviously a huge part of global trade. I don't think anyone really understands how this will work out tbh. I think the general consensus is that China has moved to a more sensible international position overall as their trade surplus is down significantly. Contrast this with Germany, a trade surplus over 8%, heavily integrated into a lot of major product markets, and likely exporting substantial amounts of deflation (Italy, Netherlands similar). And whilst China has operated in relatively good faith when it came to trade, Germany has not and has always stridently denied any responsibility (and has always done so historically too, afaik). In terms of trade, Germany/the EU is a far bigger problem than China.""]"

1) The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful

2) Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its  always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually  cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months  there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler  data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.  

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom.

**Top snippets:** Mueller hoax • SpaceX reshuffle • CPTPP moves forward

&#x200B;

**POLITICS**  
**1. The FBI is investigating a suspected smear attempt against Special Counsel Robert Mueller,** the head of the ongoing investigation into Russian election interference. A woman reached out to several journalists on October 17 claiming she had been offered money to make sexual misconduct claims against Mueller. Mueller's office immediately [referred the matter to the FBI](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/robert-mueller-fbi-hoax).  


**BUSINESS**  
**2. Elon Musk fired (and replaced) at least 7 senior leaders of the SpaceX management team** in an effort to accelerate the timeline of Starlink. Starlink is SpaceX’s attempt at providing global internet connectivity via a constellation of satellites. It’s key to SpaceX’s more ambitious plans (i.e., Mars travel) given it could provide shorter term cash to fund continued space technology development. The mandate of the replacement team is to launch the [first batch of satellites by mid-2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spacex-starlink-insight/musk-shakes-up-spacex-in-race-to-make-satellite-launch-window-sources-idUSKCN1N50FC).  


**ECONOMY**  
**3. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) replacement deal** will slash tariffs across much of the Asia-Pacific region [beginning December](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-tpp/countering-global-protectionism-pacific-trade-pact-nears-takeoff-idUSKCN1N42QV). Australia became the 6th nation to ratify the agreement triggering a 60-day countdown. The revised version is called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).  


*More context: The original TPP was in jeopardy after President Trump withdrew from negotiations; however, the remaining 11 nations finalized a revised version in January.*  


**TECH**  
**4. Waymo first to receive California approval to test self-driving cars with no backup driver** in the front seat. Alphabet’s self-driving car unit can now test \~36 truly driverless test vehicles in a variety of conditions including “[day and night testing on city streets, rural roads and highways](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving-waymo/waymo-gets-first-california-ok-for-driverless-testing-without-backup-driver-idUSKCN1N42S1).” Approximately 60 companies have permits to test self-driving vehicles with a backup driver in California.  


*More context: Waymo has already been utilizing a similar approval in Arizona and plans on launching a commercial self-driving ride hailing experience in the state by the end of 2018.*  


**BUZZ**  
**5. Boston gangster Whitey Bulger was murdered in prison** at the age of 89. He was beaten to death by inmates shortly after arrival to a new prison in West Virginia (in what may have been an organized hit). Whitey was [one of Boston’s most notorious criminals](https://www.apnews.com/40ec3f0b0a1d47369e1e9ce5eaaba019) and on the run for 16 years until his capture in 2013.

**6. India erected the world’s tallest statue.** It’s 600 ft. and [cost \~$430M to build](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-46028342). The statue took the “world’s tallest” title from the [Spring Temple Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Temple_Buddha) in China and is more than 2x the height of New York’s Statue of Liberty.  ",0.82,"[""You're a new account so we'll have the same talk we did with the other guy.

It was very “culty” for lack of a better term; there were even chants back and forth between Phil and the crowd. Something along the lines of Phil: “We want to” *waits for crowd response*; Crowd: “make money!”; Phil: “not”; Crowd: “lose money!”.\n\nI made an excuse up as to why I had to leave to the person that had invited me and got out of there at that point.', ""His youtube videos are really all you need to take from in terms of good advice.

Even though it\'s expensive, I already got my money back a few times over just by using some of the options trading techniques that are taught.

CRM11-27,9yszla,Anyone liking CRM at $15? P/E is 95!,1542726677.0,5,1,"So I bought CRM last months and am down 15%. Not a disaster but annoying. I feel like an idiot as I didn’t pay attention to the P/E which is outrageously higher than the rest of my portfolio. It makes me want to sell and reset at a reasonable P/E!

Purchased on the idea that sales force is the major crm software for businesses and didn’t see that demand going away. Also have friends working on some innovation projects over there that are pretty neat.

Who else is in or out at these levels?

It's a growth stock and if you are interested in it you need to look at it from the perspective of future earnings and not the past earnings.

Good leadership and planning could have had the sears/k-mart mashup be a strong entry in the retail space, much like walmart or target, but instead they underinvested into their retail space and were unable to make their business model efficient, so over a course of years they slowly bled out and died.\n\nEddie was the beginning of the end, and while there was some distress before that there was plenty of time and resources to right the ship and reinvent their business.', ""Search Sears on here, there's a few thread that have input from a guy who's very knowledgeable on the story.

I was a mix between Yahoo, Amazon and Facebook - offering a proto-social network, news portal and an online store. It was the dot com sensation before dot com was a thing. Unfortunately due to some bad decisions (in hindsight - online business was not understood well) nothing came out of it. They were not able to develop any of the promising leads and eventually alienated their user base by demanding more pay for the most popular social features.  They've also tried to launch a couple of financial services ventures in the 90s and 2000s but those didn't work out either. \n\nI think the problem was that Sears was too stuck up about their traditional retailer status.
