GoPro Inc. jumped as much as 8.8 percent after a report said Chinese electronics maker Xiaomi Corp. has weighed whether to make an offer for the action-camera maker.

Chief Executive Officer Nick Woodman has said he is open to a deal and earlier this year the company hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. to advise it on a potential sale. Once valued at more than $10 billion, GoPro’s market capitalization has fallen to about $761 million. A buyer could leverage GoPro’s brand and gain profit contributions from device sales, analysts have said.

GoPro could potentially fetch $1 billion, The Information said, based on the price that Hewlett Packard paid for Palm, also a struggling electronics maker, in 2010. While Xiaomi has considered an offer, it doesn’t want to overpay, The Information said, citing a person familiar with the matter.

PBCT04-19,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,8,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009.

>Mattel Inc. MAT Chief Executive Margaret “Margo” Georgiadis is in discussions to leave the toy maker, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be an abrupt exit at a company struggling with slumping sales and in the midst of a restructuring.

>The former Google executive, who joined Mattel in February 2017, has been unable to reverse the Barbie doll and Hot Wheels maker’s fortunes. She has overhauled Mattel’s management team, suspended its dividend and unveiled plans to slash $650 million in costs.

>Details of her potential departure, such as who might replace her, couldn’t be learned. Last month, the company said it would elevate director Ynon Kreiz, a former studio executive who joined the board last year, to the role of executive chairman.

>Mattel shares have fallen nearly 50% since Ms. Georgiadis took over, chopping its market value to just under $5 billion. The company’s annual sales have slipped below those of rival Hasbro Inc., which The Wall Street Journal reported last fall was exploring a potential takeover. It is unclear where those discussions currently stand.

>Mattel, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., and has 28,000 employees, has cycled through several leaders in recent years. A new CEO would be the fourth in four years. Like her predecessor, Ms. Georgiadis didn’t have experience in the toy business before taking the job.

>Ms. Georgiadis was recruited to join the toy maker in late 2016, as Mattel was signaling confidence in the looming holiday season. But Mattel’s inventories piled up at retailers and didn’t sell as expected, and the company had to cut prices to try to salvage the most critical period in the year. Sales and profits plunged as a result.

>Instead of inheriting a company on the upswing, by the time she joined after the holidays, Ms. Georgiadis found herself trying to stabilize what was then the world’s largest toy company.

>She continued to uncover more problems at Mattel. Before she arrived, Mattel leadership was trying to recoup more than $400 million in sales it lost when Hasbro took over a major Walt Disney Co. license tied to the “Frozen” movie and other princess dolls. But the slew of smaller products it turned to in an effort to close the gap added complexity and costs, and didn’t have lasting power. Some of Mattel’s other brands, like Monster High and American Girl, also slumped.

>Mattel continued to struggle last year as it tried to reduce excess inventory at retail and had to cope with the bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys “R” Us Inc., one of its biggest sales channels. Mattel’s sales fell 11% last year, its fourth-straight year of declines. The company reports its latest quarterly results next week.

[Muddy Waters Research](https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/987546286210535424) headed by Carson Block has just had its website taken down by a group apparently claiming 'Shia Iraqi' allegiance.  ([""hacked by SaTtAr_iQ""](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&ei=6-TaWvC-DsSg0wKvs4KADA&q=%22HaCKeD+by+SaTtAr+iQ%22+&oq=%22HaCKeD+by+SaTtAr+iQ%22+&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160k1l2.43488.43488.0.43764.1.1.0.0.0.0.202.202.2-1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.202....0.IAi9X2KMWE0), whose twitter profile says 'professional security', Iraq.)

A few months before in December they'd just published a rather long (and fairly well written, shame I didn't save it) report on [CIFS](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cifs) currently trading on the NYSE.

Since that report came out CIFS's stock has taken a pretty heavy blow. (From 1.3B to 500M today)  This weeks ago, however, CIFS stopped a long run of bleeding losses a week after they claimed they'd [investigate](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/china-internet-nationwide-financial-services-inc-comments-on-recent-stock-price-movement-20180410-01239).

And then all of the sudden the MW website is taken down by an ""Iraqi"" hacker.

That... kinda implies a lot.  Is this normal?  Do 'hackers' often target research firms like that?  I haven't heard of it before, let alone stumble upon it myself.

Also, doesn't this kinda imply that shorting the stock is a good idea?  Wouldn't this be the kind of action to backfire spectacularly? 

I'm assuming, of course, that an Iraqi hacker has no interest in targeting a US hedge fund known mostly for shorting Chinese companies and from what I could tell (the site was working last night) had never mentioned a single middle eastern company.

Though there appears to be a group of hackers known as [MuddyWaters](https://www.cyberscoop.com/muddywaters-trend-micro-middle-east/) that appears to be Iranian based.  Which... I think is a coincidence but a profoundly weird one, especially given the [Chinese parts that were seen as false flags](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/campaign-possibly-connected-muddywater-surfaces-middle-east-central-asia/).  (""MuddyWaters"" is referencing a [*Chinese*](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=http://chengyu.t086.com/&prev=search) proverb no less)

Honestly, I don't know what to make of it.  Just think the entire thing is kinda hilarious and absurd in its own way.  At least I would if I didn't find it a bit scary that the Chinese government would pretend to be middle eastern hackers to shut down US websites spreading information about fraud.  Kinda has bad implications.

> Grocery chains have long awaited the right conditions to charge more for their products, and a broad view of the U.S. would suggest this is their moment: Unemployment is near historic lows, consumer confidence is high and inflation is inching upward.

> But companies are finding they’re losing the power to hike prices. That’s because Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. are engaged in a battle to the death on consumer spending, while low-cost chains Aldi and Lidl pressure brick-and-mortar companies. At the same time, shoppers are becoming less loyal to legacy brand names than ever before -- meaning they’ll go generic instead of paying up for labels.

> “Retailers took advantage of lower food costs to push down prices, and customers became acclimated to that environment,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Now that inflation is returning, not only is competition in play, but customers are no longer used to seeing marginal price increases come through.”

> The forces at play are illustrated by General Mills Inc., which has acknowledged that attempted price hikes for its Progresso soup and Yoplait yogurt ultimately hurt sales. The misstep exacerbated a slump in those key businesses, as shoppers migrated to other brands. Nestle SA has also experienced difficulties in getting price increases to stick.

> It’s not just big food. Consumer companies are finding they’re being pinched by the same forces. Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc’s hygiene and home division, which sells brands such as Lysol spray and Air Wick air fresheners, showed solid volume gains in the most recent quarter, but suffered because of lower prices, sending its shares plummeting. Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies and Kleenex, reported flat or lower prices across its categories in its latest quarterly results.

> In the U.K., Tesco Plc and its competitors have started to push up prices to compensate for the post-Brexit weakening of the pound -- but it hasn’t been able to fully pass on higher costs to shoppers. In France, competition has prevented Carrefour SA and Casino Guichard Perrachon SA from implementing price hikes.

The article also mentions about Aldi and Lidi expanding into the US. I also remember a Hormel engineer talking about the pressure to cut costs in the manufacturing area, and the challenges that go along with it.

That means they are looking for different foods to eat - not the ones they necessarily grew up eating.  That makes them more price sensitive: if they're looking for something new to eat and find 3 options they've never tried before, they will probably consider cost more than if they were just buying what they're used to.\n\nThen as their diet has become more diverse there is more competition in price, since the consumer can switch to something else if prices rise in one menu category.

MAT04-26,8dhw3w,Mattel CEO to leave the company,1524169919.0,3,6,"[WSJ link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mattel-ceo-margo-georgiadis-in-talks-to-leave-the-company-1524166521)


>Mattel Inc. MAT Chief Executive Margaret “Margo” Georgiadis is in discussions to leave the toy maker, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be an abrupt exit at a company struggling with slumping sales and in the midst of a restructuring.

>The former Google executive, who joined Mattel in February 2017, has been unable to reverse the Barbie doll and Hot Wheels maker’s fortunes. She has overhauled Mattel’s management team, suspended its dividend and unveiled plans to slash $650 million in costs.

>Details of her potential departure, such as who might replace her, couldn’t be learned. Last month, the company said it would elevate director Ynon Kreiz, a former studio executive who joined the board last year, to the role of executive chairman.

>Mattel shares have fallen nearly 50% since Ms. Georgiadis took over, chopping its market value to just under $5 billion. The company’s annual sales have slipped below those of rival Hasbro Inc., which The Wall Street Journal reported last fall was exploring a potential takeover. It is unclear where those discussions currently stand.

>Mattel, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., and has 28,000 employees, has cycled through several leaders in recent years. A new CEO would be the fourth in four years. Like her predecessor, Ms. Georgiadis didn’t have experience in the toy business before taking the job.

>Ms. Georgiadis was recruited to join the toy maker in late 2016, as Mattel was signaling confidence in the looming holiday season. But Mattel’s inventories piled up at retailers and didn’t sell as expected, and the company had to cut prices to try to salvage the most critical period in the year. Sales and profits plunged as a result.

>Instead of inheriting a company on the upswing, by the time she joined after the holidays, Ms. Georgiadis found herself trying to stabilize what was then the world’s largest toy company.

>She continued to uncover more problems at Mattel. Before she arrived, Mattel leadership was trying to recoup more than $400 million in sales it lost when Hasbro took over a major Walt Disney Co. license tied to the “Frozen” movie and other princess dolls. But the slew of smaller products it turned to in an effort to close the gap added complexity and costs, and didn’t have lasting power. Some of Mattel’s other brands, like Monster High and American Girl, also slumped.

>Mattel continued to struggle last year as it tried to reduce excess inventory at retail and had to cope with the bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys “R” Us Inc., one of its biggest sales channels. Mattel’s sales fell 11% last year, its fourth-straight year of declines. The company reports its latest quarterly results next week.

At first it looks like the 5 parties all have 4.3 M shares, which seemed incorrect because 'whalewisdom' stated that there were only 2 parties with 4,3M shares. Then I found the following citation:

>These shares are owned directly as follows: (i) 3,059,616 shares of Common Stock held by VHCP II and (ii) 1,240,384 shares of Common Stock held by VHCP Co II. VHCP Management II is the general partner of VHCP II and the manager of VHCP Co II. Messrs. Koh and Shah are the managing members of VHCP Management II.

Which means the following...

**Name**                               **Number of shares:**

VHCP II                            3.059.616 (common stock)

VHCP Co II                      1.230.384 (common stock)    

**Name**                              **Governance**

VHCP II                              General partner: VHCP Management II

VHCP Co II                          Manager: VHCP Management II

VHCP Management         Managing members: Messrs. Koh & Shah

When I add up the number of stocks I came along the following total: 4.300.000, which is the half as stated on the website (where VHCP management II and VHCP II both have 4.3M shares). 

  
Could someone tell me if I'm wrong; and if so, what I do wrong; and where I possibly could have read it.

>Omnicom reported a 2 percent rise in organic revenue - a closely watched measure that excludes foreign exchange rate changes and mergers. Analysts, on average, had expected a 2.3 percent rise, according to research firm FactSet. New York-based **Omnicom has been able to offset some of its large customer losses in North America with gains in Europe, where organic revenue grew 11.2 percent in the quarter.** Organic revenue fell 0.9 percent in North America. In 2017, North America contributed nearly 57 percent to Omnicom’s revenue, while Europe contributed 27 percent.

Not a big drop, but notable that one of the ""Big Four"" advertising agencies is looking outside of the United States for growth. Europe in particular could be attractive as WPP grapples with the demons in its closet, providing an opportunity for other companies to get former WPP clients.

Or, it could just be that Omnicom's domestic clients are not seeing as much value in traditional market spend, especially with the rise of nontraditional technology-based advertising competitors.

>Omnicom also faces competition from consulting firms such as Accenture (ACN.N), IBM (IBM.N) and Deloitte, which have built big marketing businesses in recent years through acquisitions.

Perhaps its just that these advertising agencies are finding themselves playing catchup to other data-driven advertisers.

>Omnicom last week rolled out its data driven marketing and insights platform - Omni, aiming to battle the rise of internet giants Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O), which have transformed the sector by using data to better target advertising.

Competitor Interpublic announced the acquisition of data mining firm Acxiom Corp’s marketing solutions business just two weeks ago.

That is the whole principle of value investing.\n\nAfter the buyback the market could value the shares at $0.10 cents a share with a market cap of $90,000 if they want. Or they could go crazy and think the shares are worth $100.\n\nOver the short run the market cap and price per share change by the minute sometimes for reasons that are completely irrational that have nothing to do with the fundamentals.\n\nThe share buy back will move from an asset (cash) to equity (treasury stock) on the balance sheet. It does not create or destroy shareholder value unless the price changes in the future. If the price is more than $10 in the future, then shareholders benefit. If its less than $10, they lose out and the share buybacks were a bad deal. The treasury stock value will fluctuate as the share price changes. This is exactly the same dilemma of a common shareholder buying the stock on the open market at a price of $10 and experiencing changes in the future.\n\nThat is why companies should only buy back shares when they feel that they are undervalued and there are no capital investments that yield a higher rate internal rate of return.\n\nShare buybacks become evil when management ignores the value proposition of buying shares and instead use them as a tool to artificially meet EPS or share price targets so that their stock options pay out. \n\nIt can also be questionable when a company is issuing debt to perform share buyback as it could help the stock in the short term but over the long run it could leave the company over-indebted with and stuck with shares that it overpaid for. Or it could be a brilliant management move, issuing low interest debt to buy stock that appreciates over the long term. \n\nOver the long run studies have shown that buybacks destroy shareholder value because management tends to overpay for shares due to conflicts of interests. That does not mean all buy backs are bad.', 'ITT people think $1 removed as a cash asset does not translate in $1 removed from market cap.

After buyback you own 11.11% of the company (100,000 shares each worth $10 on $9million). Buybacks does not add value to market cap.

This means each share represents $1.11 of net income every year and $0 in cash.\n\nWithout talking about the theory of valuation, I think you can see that a pre-buyback share is distinctly different than a post-buyback share.

Buy back stocks of own company\n\n3a. Buy back stocks at market value(sticker price) or under sticker price, increase in shareholder value by eliminating outstanding stocks available. Good thing if you are a long term holder of the stock.\n\n3b. Buy back stocks at higher than market value. Increase in stock price because of higher demand. Terrible for equity. All this does is use up operating cash from the company and squandering it. Only people who benefit from higher stock prices are the officers of the company.\n', ""This topic has made it clearer to me why companies do buybacks if they believe the stock is undervalued. If they're correct, buybacks create value for shareholders, because the bigger share of future expected profits are a greater value than the cash on hand used to buy them.\n\nIs it conversely a standard for companies to issue new stock when they think their price is too high? That would also create value for current stockholders - their stake in the company would go \\*down\\* but cash on hand would go up for more than that stake was really worth."", 'Are you trolling with this question?', 'Buybacks temporarily increase the demand of the stock in the market which increases the price. It’s more or less this simple.', '[deleted]', 'Long story short, they use debt to fund buybacks. The market likes debt. ', 'Future profits are split between 9 million shares rather than 10. ', ""The revenue of the company doesn't go down because of buy backs. The P/E ratio improves."", ""You're missing the part where their earnings per share goes up, so they become undervalued.\n\nIt's both buying pressure and better financials"", 'Simple. Something which is useful and decreasing in quantity must increase in price', '[deleted]', ""What you're asking is the same as asking why a company would go up in price if they grew their dividend over time. While yes there is a reduction in cash on hand, this is a signal to the market that the company believes they are in a position to reward shareholders while continuing to operate and achieve expected results. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe math you are trying to work out doesn't work because markets don't use book value analysis to decide on price. Otherwise the value of every company would be a simple formula. "", 'Its important to remember there was a reason share buy backs were illegal in the US for years.\n\nIf a company can buy there own shares, how is this not insider trading? (The black out period for a month before earnings are released?) Come on this is hands down being used by insiders to profit.\n\nIt would be more legit if they bought back shares and then cancelled them so they simply dont exist anymore.']"
