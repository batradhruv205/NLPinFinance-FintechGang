GoPro Inc. jumped as much as 8.8 percent after a report said Chinese electronics maker Xiaomi Corp. has weighed whether to make an offer for the action-camera maker.

Chief Executive Officer Nick Woodman has said he is open to a deal and earlier this year the company hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. to advise it on a potential sale. Once valued at more than $10 billion, GoPro’s market capitalization has fallen to about $761 million. A buyer could leverage GoPro’s brand and gain profit contributions from device sales, analysts have said.

GoPro could potentially fetch $1 billion, The Information said, based on the price that Hewlett Packard paid for Palm, also a struggling electronics maker, in 2010. While Xiaomi has considered an offer, it doesn’t want to overpay, The Information said, citing a person familiar with the matter.

> Growing numbers of small subprime auto lenders are closing or shutting down after loan losses and slim margins spur banks and private equity owners to cut off funding.

> Summit Financial Corp., a Plantation, Florida-based subprime car finance company, filed for bankruptcy late last month after lenders including Bank of America Corp. said it had misreported losses from soured loans. And a creditor to Spring Tree Lending, an Atlanta-based subprime auto lender, filed to force the company into bankruptcy last week, after a separate group of investors accused the company of fraud. Private equity-backed Pelican Auto Finance, which specialized in “deep subprime” borrowers, finished winding down last month after seeing its profit margins shrink.

> This time around, the financial system’s losses are expected to be much more manageable, because auto lending is a smaller business relative to mortgages, and Wall Street hasn’t packaged as many of the loans into complicated securities and derivatives. As of the end of September, there were about $280 billion of subprime auto loans outstanding, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, compared with around $1.3 trillion in subprime mortgage debt at the start of 2007.

Tesla (TSLA): This just out of fanboyism, I love Elon Musk. He's awesome. And, anyway, Tesla does civilian and governmental contracting, e.g selling cars to the public and solar panels to the government, etc. 

Gaming and eSports:

Activision Blizzard (ATVI): The world's leading video game publisher, also owns Overwatch of which I, and others, love. 

Riot Games (HKG: 0700): League of Legends is consistently one of the most watched game on Twitch and the tournaments for the game net millions. The industry can only grow too, us kids aren't just going to stop playing. 

Transportation:

Boeing (BA): Boeing is an unstoppable juggernaut. Airlines love them, people love them, and countries love them. They sell airplanes, rockets, satellites, all the cool stuff, and they own a huge percent of the aeronautics industry. They're unstoppable!

Pharmaceuticals:

AbbVie Inc (ABBV): Will eclipse $35bn by 2025, and, like JNJ, pays out good dividends. Revenue is growing very fast, with Wall Street believing ABBV will have a 16% annualized profit growth each year for the next five. That's pretty fast. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): While it did lose profit by losing its patent protection, it recently launched two new megablockbuster drugs of which are offsetting these losses. Might be fun to see how this stock does. 

Johnson and Johnson (JNJ): One of the best healthcare stocks, JNJ is growing faster than any other pharma corp and it yields an awesome dividend. 

Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND): Is a fast growing pharma corp that has a $2.9bn mid cap. Will also be interesting to see where this one goes. 

Index Funds:

Fidelity MSCI information Tech (FTEC): 27.49% annual returns according to USA News, and has $1.88bn worth of assets. 

Vanguard Information Technology (VGT): 27.5% annual returns, also according to USA News, and has $20.05bn worth of assets.

PBCT04-19,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,6,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

KEY04-19,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,9,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

FirstEnergy said the move would facilitate an “orderly financial restructuring” and accelerate its strategy to become a fully regulated utility.

> In a much-criticized move, FES on March 29 also filed an application for an emergency order with the DOE under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, urging Energy Secretary Rick Perry to “find an emergency condition exists” in PJM’s region, and to force PJM to compensate at-risk merchant nuclear and coal plants to maintain stability of the grid.

> The FirstEnergy Corp. parent company isn’t part of the chapter 11 case, nor are other company subsidiaries that operate in regulated electricity markets. But creditors are considering asserting claims that the parent failed to honor its financial obligations to the bankrupt units, a person familiar with the matter said.

> The company’s collection of coal and nuclear plants had been flirting with bankruptcy since last year when FirstEnergy announced it would exit competitive power markets and refocus on its regulated businesses.

> As part of the bankruptcy, FirstEnergy Solutions is seeking to scrap its unprofitable contracts to buy power from wind- and solar-power plants. The company is asking a bankruptcy judge to step in and rule that FERC can’t force FirstEnergy to continue to honor the deals. 

> FirstEnergy Solutions, which had 2017 revenue of $3.1 billion, plans to pursue a “dual-path exit from chapter 11”—either via a creditor-supported chapter 11 plan or the sale of some or all of the assets—according to court papers.

> Although FERC denied Perry's proposed rule in January, FirstEnergy is banking that Perry, and by extension the Trump Administration, would be willing to issue an emergency order to keep its plants running under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act. According to the DOE, that rule is meant to ensure grid operations during emergencies.

> The rule was used six times between 2000 and 2008, in response to California's 2000 energy crisis and Hurricane Katrina, among other events. The rule wasn't used again until 2017, when the DOE permitted a coal generator to continue operation for four months at the Grand River Energy Center in Oklahoma while a new gas generator came online. It was also used in June 2017 to permit the limited run of two coal-fired generators in Virginia.

Based on my preliminary DD, FE is making a late/slow transition to natural gas plants. I'm still trying to determine how much revenue/profit FE's subsidiaries were contributing to FE.

FE severed their ties with FES the day before the bankruptcy filing (including denying FES from accessing FE's bank accounts), but it looks like some of the creditors are insisting that FE should be responsible for their bankrupt subsidiaries' debt.

I'm expecting the market to react as if FE itself is filing for bankruptcy in the short term.

In the long term, the question is how will those bankruptcies be handled (with creditors wanting to go after FE), if FE's subsidiaries can get government bailout using a rule that has been used before, and if FE can shift their business to avoid being crushed by cheap natural gas and stagnant electricity demand.

What am I going to do? Haven't decided yet.",1.0,"[""First time commenting on this thread but I happen to be keeping a close eye on this myself. FE has been cut-clear on its intentions to get out of the deregulated generation business in order to shore up its value on WS. \n\nFEU (aka FE) itself is independent of FES (generation) and is solely banking on revenue garnered from delivering and distributing energy across its footprint.  Why? Because operating and maintaining a nuke plant can't compete with natural gas in a deregulated market.  They tried and although it'd be easy to say they failed, it's also easy to say that maybe electricity generation - while historically a private industry - shouldn't be open to the free market.  \n\nBack to my point - FE is positioning itself into a predictive, conservative revenue pattern by getting out of the generation business.

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

RF04-20,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,6,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

> FirstEnergy Corp.’s competitive arm FirstEnergy Solutions (FES) and several key subsidiaries, including FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Co. (FENOC), on March 31 sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. FirstEnergy said the move would facilitate an “orderly financial restructuring” and accelerate its strategy to become a fully regulated utility.

> In a much-criticized move, FES on March 29 also filed an application for an emergency order with the DOE under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, urging Energy Secretary Rick Perry to “find an emergency condition exists” in PJM’s region, and to force PJM to compensate at-risk merchant nuclear and coal plants to maintain stability of the grid.

> The bankrupt FirstEnergy affiliates operate seven power facilities in Midwestern power markets where aggressive competition from cheaper gas-fired and renewable energy sources has undercut the economics of traditional nuclear and coal plants.

> The FirstEnergy Corp. parent company isn’t part of the chapter 11 case, nor are other company subsidiaries that operate in regulated electricity markets. But creditors are considering asserting claims that the parent failed to honor its financial obligations to the bankrupt units, a person familiar with the matter said.

> The company’s collection of coal and nuclear plants had been flirting with bankruptcy since last year when FirstEnergy announced it would exit competitive power markets and refocus on its regulated businesses.

> As part of the bankruptcy, FirstEnergy Solutions is seeking to scrap its unprofitable contracts to buy power from wind- and solar-power plants. The company is asking a bankruptcy judge to step in and rule that FERC can’t force FirstEnergy to continue to honor the deals. 

> FirstEnergy Solutions, which had 2017 revenue of $3.1 billion, plans to pursue a “dual-path exit from chapter 11”—either via a creditor-supported chapter 11 plan or the sale of some or all of the assets—according to court papers.

https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/coal-nuclear-plant-operator-files-for-bankruptcy-asks-trump-for-a-bailout/

> Although FERC denied Perry's proposed rule in January, FirstEnergy is banking that Perry, and by extension the Trump Administration, would be willing to issue an emergency order to keep its plants running under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act. According to the DOE, that rule is meant to ensure grid operations during emergencies.

> The rule was used six times between 2000 and 2008, in response to California's 2000 energy crisis and Hurricane Katrina, among other events. The rule wasn't used again until 2017, when the DOE permitted a coal generator to continue operation for four months at the Grand River Energy Center in Oklahoma while a new gas generator came online.

GOOGL04-24,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,8,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

“Think of strategic investments and M&A as playing a game of go,” said Mr. Tsai, the Alibaba executive vice chairman, at the investor conference last year. “In a game of go the strategic objective is to put your pieces on the chessboard and surround your opponent.”",0.7,"['their biggest tech companies are just ripoffs of us tech companies that operate solely in China.

> FirstEnergy Corp.’s competitive arm FirstEnergy Solutions (FES) and several key subsidiaries, including FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Co. (FENOC), on March 31 sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. FirstEnergy said the move would facilitate an “orderly financial restructuring” and accelerate its strategy to become a fully regulated utility.

> In a much-criticized move, FES on March 29 also filed an application for an emergency order with the DOE under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, urging Energy Secretary Rick Perry to “find an emergency condition exists” in PJM’s region, and to force PJM to compensate at-risk merchant nuclear and coal plants to maintain stability of the grid.

> The bankrupt FirstEnergy affiliates operate seven power facilities in Midwestern power markets where aggressive competition from cheaper gas-fired and renewable energy sources has undercut the economics of traditional nuclear and coal plants.

> The FirstEnergy Corp. parent company isn’t part of the chapter 11 case, nor are other company subsidiaries that operate in regulated electricity markets. But creditors are considering asserting claims that the parent failed to honor its financial obligations to the bankrupt units, a person familiar with the matter said.

> The company’s collection of coal and nuclear plants had been flirting with bankruptcy since last year when FirstEnergy announced it would exit competitive power markets and refocus on its regulated businesses.

> As part of the bankruptcy, FirstEnergy Solutions is seeking to scrap its unprofitable contracts to buy power from wind- and solar-power plants. The company is asking a bankruptcy judge to step in and rule that FERC can’t force FirstEnergy to continue to honor the deals. 

> FirstEnergy Solutions, which had 2017 revenue of $3.1 billion, plans to pursue a “dual-path exit from chapter 11”—either via a creditor-supported chapter 11 plan or the sale of some or all of the assets—according to court papers.

https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/coal-nuclear-plant-operator-files-for-bankruptcy-asks-trump-for-a-bailout/

> Although FERC denied Perry's proposed rule in January, FirstEnergy is banking that Perry, and by extension the Trump Administration, would be willing to issue an emergency order to keep its plants running under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act. According to the DOE, that rule is meant to ensure grid operations during emergencies.

> The rule was used six times between 2000 and 2008, in response to California's 2000 energy crisis and Hurricane Katrina, among other events. The rule wasn't used again until 2017, when the DOE permitted a coal generator to continue operation for four months at the Grand River Energy Center in Oklahoma while a new gas generator came online. It was also used in June 2017 to permit the limited run of two coal-fired generators in Virginia.

> PG&E Corp. has been losing customers in tony Marin County north of San Francisco since 2010 to a new kind of rival, and says their growing popularity is costing the utility’s remaining customers, to the tune of $180 million last year. That could balloon to $500 million in the early 2020s, according to a statement Tuesday.

> California’s big three utilities are looking for ways to address this emerging issue. They helped make the state a clean-energy leader by striking some of the first big deals to buy wind and solar power. Problem is, those early contracts came with higher prices that were typically locked in for decades, and it’s costing them customers.

> The utilities are facing smaller local suppliers that are signing their own power-purchase deals at current, lower rates, and then siphoning off customers by passing on the discounts. At least 4.5 million California homes and businesses will be getting electricity from them by yearend, according to the California Community Choice Association, which represents these new power companies.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-proposes-reforms-support-160000811.html

> Also in 2002, California’s legislature authorized the formation of CCAs, allowing cities and counties to purchase and/or generate electricity for their residents and businesses. The first CCA began in PG&E’s service area in 2010. Likewise, customers can choose to receive their electricity from other third-party suppliers called Energy Service Providers (ESPs). For both CCA and ESP customers, PG&E continues to deliver the energy and provide meter reading, billing, maintenance and emergency response services.

> Today, communities that choose to implement CCA programs or customers that choose ESPs are responsible for the PCIA charge associated with energy resources procured on their behalf. PG&E does not make any money on the PCIA. The PCIA charge is required to ensure that all customers are treated equally and do not pay for other customers’ share of costs.

> However, the current PCIA formula has become unbalanced over time due to the growth of CCAs. **In 2017, CCA customers only paid approximately 65 percent of the costs associated with the energy resources procured on their behalf. This imbalance required PG&E customers who were not part of a CCA to pay approximately $180 million to subsidize CCA customers. Assuming this trend continues, in the early 2020s this amount is expected to grow to half a billion dollars, which is equal to the current PG&E low-income subsidy.**

TL;DR: The three major utility companies are stuck with old, expensive contracts, and are being undercut by cheaper competitors as a result.

> Grocery chains have long awaited the right conditions to charge more for their products, and a broad view of the U.S. would suggest this is their moment: Unemployment is near historic lows, consumer confidence is high and inflation is inching upward.

> But companies are finding they’re losing the power to hike prices. That’s because Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. are engaged in a battle to the death on consumer spending, while low-cost chains Aldi and Lidl pressure brick-and-mortar companies. At the same time, shoppers are becoming less loyal to legacy brand names than ever before -- meaning they’ll go generic instead of paying up for labels.

> “Retailers took advantage of lower food costs to push down prices, and customers became acclimated to that environment,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Now that inflation is returning, not only is competition in play, but customers are no longer used to seeing marginal price increases come through.”

> The forces at play are illustrated by General Mills Inc., which has acknowledged that attempted price hikes for its Progresso soup and Yoplait yogurt ultimately hurt sales. The misstep exacerbated a slump in those key businesses, as shoppers migrated to other brands. Nestle SA has also experienced difficulties in getting price increases to stick.

> It’s not just big food. Consumer companies are finding they’re being pinched by the same forces. Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc’s hygiene and home division, which sells brands such as Lysol spray and Air Wick air fresheners, showed solid volume gains in the most recent quarter, but suffered because of lower prices, sending its shares plummeting. Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies and Kleenex, reported flat or lower prices across its categories in its latest quarterly results.

> In the U.K., Tesco Plc and its competitors have started to push up prices to compensate for the post-Brexit weakening of the pound -- but it hasn’t been able to fully pass on higher costs to shoppers. In France, competition has prevented Carrefour SA and Casino Guichard Perrachon SA from implementing price hikes.

The company’s annual sales have slipped below those of rival Hasbro Inc., which The Wall Street Journal reported last fall was exploring a potential takeover. It is unclear where those discussions currently stand.

>Mattel, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., and has 28,000 employees, has cycled through several leaders in recent years. A new CEO would be the fourth in four years. Like her predecessor, Ms. Georgiadis didn’t have experience in the toy business before taking the job.

>Ms. Georgiadis was recruited to join the toy maker in late 2016, as Mattel was signaling confidence in the looming holiday season. But Mattel’s inventories piled up at retailers and didn’t sell as expected, and the company had to cut prices to try to salvage the most critical period in the year. Sales and profits plunged as a result.

>Instead of inheriting a company on the upswing, by the time she joined after the holidays, Ms. Georgiadis found herself trying to stabilize what was then the world’s largest toy company.

>She continued to uncover more problems at Mattel. Before she arrived, Mattel leadership was trying to recoup more than $400 million in sales it lost when Hasbro took over a major Walt Disney Co. license tied to the “Frozen” movie and other princess dolls. But the slew of smaller products it turned to in an effort to close the gap added complexity and costs, and didn’t have lasting power. Some of Mattel’s other brands, like Monster High and American Girl, also slumped.

>Mattel continued to struggle last year as it tried to reduce excess inventory at retail and had to cope with the bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys “R” Us Inc., one of its biggest sales channels. Mattel’s sales fell 11% last year, its fourth-straight year of declines. The company reports its latest quarterly results next week.

GLW04-24,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,7,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

>RATINGS RATIONALE

>Tesla's ratings reflect the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company's Model 3 electric vehicle. The company also faces liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities of convertible bonds ($230 million in November 2018 and $920 million in March 2019). Tesla produced only 2,425 Model 3s during the fourth quarter of 2017; it is currently targeting a weekly production rate of 2,500 by the end of March, and 5,000 per week by the end of June. This compares with the company's year-earlier production expectations of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017 and 10,000 by the end of 2018.

>The Caa1 rating of the unsecured notes reflects the junior position of the notes relative to the company's $1.9 billion secured credit facility.

>Tesla continues to benefit from solid market acceptance of Models S and X, which collectively hold over a third of the US luxury market. In addition, third-party evaluations of the Model 3 remain favorable, consumer response to the vehicle is sound, and advance purchase reservations and deposits remain high. Finally, regulatory support for battery electric and zero-emission vehicles continues to grow.

>The negative outlook reflects the likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity short-fall. Prospects for addressing its liquidity requirements (whether equity, convertible notes or debt) will be supported if the company can establish credibility for reaching Model 3 production levels -- 2,500 per week by the end of March, and 5,000 per week by the end of June.

>Tesla's liquidity consists principally of $3.4 billion in cash and securities at December 31, 2017. The company also has moderate availability under the $1.9 billion ABL facility. This liquidity position is not adequate to cover: 1) the approximately $500 million in minimum cash that we estimate Tesla must maintain for normal operations; 2) a 2018 operating cash burn that will approximate $2 billion if Tesla maintains high discretionary capital expenditures to increase capacity; and 3) convertible debt maturities of approximately $1.2 billion through early 2019. These cash needs will likely require Tesla to undertake a near-term capital raise exceeding $2 billion. Moreover, if the company maintains its expected pace of expansion, it will likely need to raise additional capital during the second half of 2019.

>Tesla's rating could be lowered further if there are shortfalls from its updated Model 3 production targets. The rating will also be pressured if the company is unable to raise sufficient new capital to cover its late-2018 and early-2019 convertible maturities, and to cover the operating cash consumption that will likely continue into 2019.

T04-25,89o7dj,Spotify: worth more than the entire music industry?,1522836774.0,101,91,"[$SPOT](https://stockflare.com/stock/spot.k) closed yesterday at $149 with a valuation of $27bn. Wall Street's target price is $238 a share, so they say *Buy*.

But let's do a little comparison with [Vivendi](https://stockflare.com/stock/viv.pa) who own Universal Music, the largest music publisher with 29% market share or [Sony](https://stockflare.com/stock/sne) with 22% [market share](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/global-market-shares-2016-sony-and-warner-gain-on-universal-as-indies-rule/)

|Metric|Spotify|Vivendi|Sony|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Value $ inc. cash | 27bn | 36bn | 51bn |
|Forecast sales $ | $7bn | $17bn | $82bn | 
|% music | 100% | 54% | 9% | 
|Value / Sales | 4.2x | 2.1x | 0.6x | 

We don't have a way to value the entire music industry, but say 50% of Vivendi and 10% of Sony equals 50% of the industry, that implies $46bn. 

So if Spotify hits the $238 price target its $43bn would be in striking distance of the whole music publishing industry.

Entirely possible? **Yes**.

But as the [vampire squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_squid#Cultural_references) might say: looks like $SPOT needs to grow into its valuation.

I know price targets can often be a little too optimistic but that price target is nuts with that company and the looming uncertainty in this current environment.\n\nI’ll say this. Spotify’s numbers and support turned out better than I expected but I still think they’ll end up way overvalued and struggle to distance themselves from competition.

But you are right the valuation is too high"", ""I commented on another post here, but it would be nice to have an actual discussion about this. \n\nI think the high valuation comes from an unrecognized potential of creators and musicians that the current music industry has been neglecting or taking advantage of (and not from the listeners of the current library). \n\nIt has never been easier or cheaper to publish your own creations via [Spotify for Artisits](https://artists.spotify.com/faq#is-there-a-spotify-for-artists-app), and possibly monetize from it. It's not upload to YouTube easy, but I can see how this potential can add value to Spotify. \n\nHaving musicians in my family, I was blown away when my younger cousin shared a link at Christmas this year instead of another CD or virtual copy download link of his band. I actually have his album saved on my Spotify account, so I can listen whenever (or stream at family gatherings). \n\nI can see how Wall Street might see this potential as really shifting the music industry as we know it.

A market previously dominated by radio and largely un-monetized by music publishers, as it functions more as advertising than a revenue stream.\n\nPeople who would have previously just listened to the radio, and paid or bought nothing, are instead paying for a Spotify subscription.\n\nInvestors are betting that a Spotify subscription is something that will be ubiquitous as having a Facebook account, and with a similarly new revenue stream.  \n\nAlso the nature of the new distribution method puts the traditional publishers long term business model in question (will Spotify, or more accurately streaming services in general, replace buying music in the future?), so it stands to reason they would not see a proportionate rise in value, despite benefiting from the new revenue in short term.\n \nThis doesn't justify the entirety of the valuation (or that the valuation is accurate or otherwise good) but it is a part that somewhat justifies the difference in perceived value between the traditional publishers and Spotify."", ""I just can't wrap my head around why anyone would buy a stock like this.  it looks like they lost 96 million dollars in Q4 of 2016.

Lets seem them dominate the space am make a profit.  I bet the competitive edge isn't so great anyone once they try and get into the black.  Basically any business losing so much money should be able to easily out compete business that are making money.  If Spotify starts playing more adds, i'll switch over to pandora.

FB04-25,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,8,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

“Think of strategic investments and M&A as playing a game of go,” said Mr. Tsai, the Alibaba executive vice chairman, at the investor conference last year. “In a game of go the strategic objective is to put your pieces on the chessboard and surround your opponent.”",0.7,"['their biggest tech companies are just ripoffs of us tech companies that operate solely in China.

>Moody's downgrades Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) corporate family rating to B3, senior notes to Caa1. Outlook is negative.

>Moody\'s Investors Servicedowngraded Tesla, Inc.'s (Tesla) Corporate Family Rating (CFR) to B3 from B2, unsecured note rating to Caa1 from B3, and Speculative Grade Liquidity rating to SGL-4 from SGL-3. The outlook is negative.

>RATINGS RATIONALE

>Tesla's ratings reflect the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company's Model 3 electric vehicle. The company also faces liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities of convertible bonds ($230 million in November 2018 and $920 million in March 2019). Tesla produced only 2,425 Model 3s during the fourth quarter of 2017; it is currently targeting a weekly production rate of 2,500 by the end of March, and 5,000 per week by the end of June. This compares with the company's year-earlier production expectations of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017 and 10,000 by the end of 2018.

>The Caa1 rating of the unsecured notes reflects the junior position of the notes relative to the company's $1.9 billion secured credit facility.

>Tesla continues to benefit from solid market acceptance of Models S and X, which collectively hold over a third of the US luxury market. In addition, third-party evaluations of the Model 3 remain favorable, consumer response to the vehicle is sound, and advance purchase reservations and deposits remain high. Finally, regulatory support for battery electric and zero-emission vehicles continues to grow.

>The negative outlook reflects the likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity short-fall. Prospects for addressing its liquidity requirements (whether equity, convertible notes or debt) will be supported if the company can establish credibility for reaching Model 3 production levels -- 2,500 per week by the end of March, and 5,000 per week by the end of June.

>Tesla's liquidity consists principally of $3.4 billion in cash and securities at December 31, 2017. The company also has moderate availability under the $1.9 billion ABL facility. This liquidity position is not adequate to cover: 1) the approximately $500 million in minimum cash that we estimate Tesla must maintain for normal operations; 2) a 2018 operating cash burn that will approximate $2 billion if Tesla maintains high discretionary capital expenditures to increase capacity; and 3) convertible debt maturities of approximately $1.2 billion through early 2019. These cash needs will likely require Tesla to undertake a near-term capital raise exceeding $2 billion. Moreover, if the company maintains its expected pace of expansion, it will likely need to raise additional capital during the second half of 2019.

>Tesla's rating could be lowered further if there are shortfalls from its updated Model 3 production targets. The rating will also be pressured if the company is unable to raise sufficient new capital to cover its late-2018 and early-2019 convertible maturities, and to cover the operating cash consumption that will likely continue into 2019.

>The rating could be raised if production rates of the Model 3 meet Tesla's current expectations and if the company maintains good liquidity.

>The following rating actions were taken:

>Downgrades:

>..Issuer: Tesla, Inc.

>.... Probability of Default Rating, Downgraded to B3-PD from B2-PD

[Muddy Waters Research](https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/987546286210535424) headed by Carson Block has just had its website taken down by a group apparently claiming 'Shia Iraqi' allegiance.

A few months before in December they'd just published a rather long (and fairly well written, shame I didn't save it) report on [CIFS](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cifs) currently trading on the NYSE.

Since that report came out CIFS's stock has taken a pretty heavy blow. (From 1.3B to 500M today)  This weeks ago, however, CIFS stopped a long run of bleeding losses a week after they claimed they'd [investigate](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/china-internet-nationwide-financial-services-inc-comments-on-recent-stock-price-movement-20180410-01239).

And then all of the sudden the MW website is taken down by an ""Iraqi"" hacker.

That... kinda implies a lot.  Is this normal?  Do 'hackers' often target research firms like that?  I haven't heard of it before, let alone stumble upon it myself.

Also, doesn't this kinda imply that shorting the stock is a good idea?  Wouldn't this be the kind of action to backfire spectacularly? 

I'm assuming, of course, that an Iraqi hacker has no interest in targeting a US hedge fund known mostly for shorting Chinese companies and from what I could tell (the site was working last night) had never mentioned a single middle eastern company.

Though there appears to be a group of hackers known as [MuddyWaters](https://www.cyberscoop.com/muddywaters-trend-micro-middle-east/) that appears to be Iranian based.  Which... I think is a coincidence but a profoundly weird one, especially given the [Chinese parts that were seen as false flags](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/campaign-possibly-connected-muddywater-surfaces-middle-east-central-asia/).  (""MuddyWaters"" is referencing a [*Chinese*](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=http://chengyu.t086.com/&prev=search) proverb no less)

Honestly, I don't know what to make of it.  Just think the entire thing is kinda hilarious and absurd in its own way.  At least I would if I didn't find it a bit scary that the Chinese government would pretend to be middle eastern hackers to shut down US websites spreading information about fraud.

> The U.S. is examining ways to retaliate against Beijing’s restrictions on U.S. providers of cloud computing and other high-tech services, effectively opening a new front on its trade offensive against China.

> According to individuals familiar with the administration’s thinking, the U.S. trade representative’s office is putting together a fresh trade complaint, probably under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, arguing that the Beijing unfairly restricts U.S. trade in these high-tech services.

> The trade representative has yet to decide whether to go ahead with the complaint, the individuals said, which would be in addition to recent moves to ratchet up pressure on China, including the imposition of tariffs on a total of $150 billion in Chinese imports. But USTR, which has taken the lead in the China trade fight, views China’s restrictions on cloud computing as providing a clear-cut example that might garner public support.

> Beijing requires U.S. cloud-computing firms, such as  Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to form joint operations with Chinese companies and license their technology to the Chinese partners. The USTR has said in reports on Chinese trade practices that Beijing withholds licenses that would allow U.S. firms to operate independently in China.

> As a result, U.S. companies can’t market their cloud-computing services in China or sign up customers directly. Chinese firms, such as Alibaba Group Holding , by comparison, are allowed to operate in the U.S. without restriction.

> “Some non-Chinese companies are reluctant to participate in China’s cloud market due to the number of restrictions,” said K.C. Swanson, director of global policy for the Telecommunications Industry Association. “Meanwhile the U.S. has no restrictions on foreign participation in our markets, it’s a clear-cut reciprocity issue.”

I.e., US tech companies have a massive competitive advantage over Chinese companies so China blocks/subsidises its industry so that it doesn't get squashed? Isn't this exactly what the US is complaining about with steel and aluminum? I feel like this complaint would get dumped on by legitimate policy wonks and it seems like Trump is actually looking to put China in a trade deficit rather than settle the score.

> Grocery chains have long awaited the right conditions to charge more for their products, and a broad view of the U.S. would suggest this is their moment: Unemployment is near historic lows, consumer confidence is high and inflation is inching upward.

> But companies are finding they’re losing the power to hike prices. That’s because Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. are engaged in a battle to the death on consumer spending, while low-cost chains Aldi and Lidl pressure brick-and-mortar companies. At the same time, shoppers are becoming less loyal to legacy brand names than ever before -- meaning they’ll go generic instead of paying up for labels.

> “Retailers took advantage of lower food costs to push down prices, and customers became acclimated to that environment,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Now that inflation is returning, not only is competition in play, but customers are no longer used to seeing marginal price increases come through.”

> The forces at play are illustrated by General Mills Inc., which has acknowledged that attempted price hikes for its Progresso soup and Yoplait yogurt ultimately hurt sales. The misstep exacerbated a slump in those key businesses, as shoppers migrated to other brands. Nestle SA has also experienced difficulties in getting price increases to stick.

> It’s not just big food. Consumer companies are finding they’re being pinched by the same forces. Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc’s hygiene and home division, which sells brands such as Lysol spray and Air Wick air fresheners, showed solid volume gains in the most recent quarter, but suffered because of lower prices, sending its shares plummeting. Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies and Kleenex, reported flat or lower prices across its categories in its latest quarterly results.

> In the U.K., Tesco Plc and its competitors have started to push up prices to compensate for the post-Brexit weakening of the pound -- but it hasn’t been able to fully pass on higher costs to shoppers. In France, competition has prevented Carrefour SA and Casino Guichard Perrachon SA from implementing price hikes.

AMZN04-26,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,8,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

Technology -

Microsoft (MSFT): Stable growth over the past thirty something years, constantly competes with Apple and Google for market share. 

Google (GOOGL): Similarly, Google has held a large portion of the tech market along with making insane profits annually. As an added benefit, it has steadily grown and the only thing I can think of that's negative is the YouTube bots fiasco. 

Tesla (TSLA): This just out of fanboyism, I love Elon Musk. He's awesome. And, anyway, Tesla does civilian and governmental contracting, e.g selling cars to the public and solar panels to the government, etc. 

Gaming and eSports:

Activision Blizzard (ATVI): The world's leading video game publisher, also owns Overwatch of which I, and others, love. 

Riot Games (HKG: 0700): League of Legends is consistently one of the most watched game on Twitch and the tournaments for the game net millions. The industry can only grow too, us kids aren't just going to stop playing. 

Transportation:

Boeing (BA): Boeing is an unstoppable juggernaut. Airlines love them, people love them, and countries love them. They sell airplanes, rockets, satellites, all the cool stuff, and they own a huge percent of the aeronautics industry. They're unstoppable!

Pharmaceuticals:

AbbVie Inc (ABBV): Will eclipse $35bn by 2025, and, like JNJ, pays out good dividends. Revenue is growing very fast, with Wall Street believing ABBV will have a 16% annualized profit growth each year for the next five. That's pretty fast. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): While it did lose profit by losing its patent protection, it recently launched two new megablockbuster drugs of which are offsetting these losses. Might be fun to see how this stock does. 

Johnson and Johnson (JNJ): One of the best healthcare stocks, JNJ is growing faster than any other pharma corp and it yields an awesome dividend. 

Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND): Is a fast growing pharma corp that has a $2.9bn mid cap. Will also be interesting to see where this one goes. 

Index Funds:

Fidelity MSCI information Tech (FTEC): 27.49% annual returns according to USA News, and has $1.88bn worth of assets. 

Vanguard Information Technology (VGT): 27.5% annual returns, also according to USA News, and has $20.05bn worth of assets. 

Wall Street Bets:

Micron Techonology (MU): The stock goes up and down, up and down, just like my portfolio!

Nvidia (NVDA): Same reason as Micron. 

AMD (AMD): I'm an autist, alright? Leave me alone. 

Outside of stocks, I'd probably invest in some real estate in Delhi, Shanghai and/or Tokyo. Also, obviously, I'm joking about the r/wsb stuff. Anyways, what companies would you invest in? Why?

AEP04-26,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,8,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

> General Motors Co. will end a 25-year-long practice of disclosing monthly vehicle-sales results and shift to quarterly reporting, complicating investors’ efforts to gauge the health of the U.S. auto market.

> “Thirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market,” Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president of sales operations, said in a statement Tuesday. GM stopped holding a monthly conference call with analysts and media in January 2014 and discontinued releases of monthly production figures months earlier.

> GM’s break from tradition will impede investors’ ability to gauge the annualized sales pace of the world’s second-largest auto market on a monthly basis, as data from the top-selling car company in the country will go missing. The switch comes as analysts widely expect industrywide deliveries to slump for the second year in a row after an unprecedented seven-year growth spurt.

> The trade representative has yet to decide whether to go ahead with the complaint, the individuals said, which would be in addition to recent moves to ratchet up pressure on China, including the imposition of tariffs on a total of $150 billion in Chinese imports. But USTR, which has taken the lead in the China trade fight, views China’s restrictions on cloud computing as providing a clear-cut example that might garner public support.

> Beijing requires U.S. cloud-computing firms, such as  Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to form joint operations with Chinese companies and license their technology to the Chinese partners. The USTR has said in reports on Chinese trade practices that Beijing withholds licenses that would allow U.S. firms to operate independently in China.

MSFT04-26,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,6,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

“Think of strategic investments and M&A as playing a game of go,” said Mr. Tsai, the Alibaba executive vice chairman, at the investor conference last year. “In a game of go the strategic objective is to put your pieces on the chessboard and surround your opponent.”",0.66,"['their biggest tech companies are just ripoffs of us tech companies that operate solely in China.

Gaming and eSports:

Activision Blizzard (ATVI): The world's leading video game publisher, also owns Overwatch of which I, and others, love. 

Riot Games (HKG: 0700): League of Legends is consistently one of the most watched game on Twitch and the tournaments for the game net millions. The industry can only grow too, us kids aren't just going to stop playing. 

Transportation:

Boeing (BA): Boeing is an unstoppable juggernaut. Airlines love them, people love them, and countries love them. They sell airplanes, rockets, satellites, all the cool stuff, and they own a huge percent of the aeronautics industry. They're unstoppable!

Pharmaceuticals:

AbbVie Inc (ABBV): Will eclipse $35bn by 2025, and, like JNJ, pays out good dividends. Revenue is growing very fast, with Wall Street believing ABBV will have a 16% annualized profit growth each year for the next five. That's pretty fast. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): While it did lose profit by losing its patent protection, it recently launched two new megablockbuster drugs of which are offsetting these losses. Might be fun to see how this stock does. 

Johnson and Johnson (JNJ): One of the best healthcare stocks, JNJ is growing faster than any other pharma corp and it yields an awesome dividend. 

Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND): Is a fast growing pharma corp that has a $2.9bn mid cap. Will also be interesting to see where this one goes. 

Index Funds:

Fidelity MSCI information Tech (FTEC): 27.49% annual returns according to USA News, and has $1.88bn worth of assets. 

Vanguard Information Technology (VGT): 27.5% annual returns, also according to USA News, and has $20.05bn worth of assets.

>The former Google executive, who joined Mattel in February 2017, has been unable to reverse the Barbie doll and Hot Wheels maker’s fortunes. She has overhauled Mattel’s management team, suspended its dividend and unveiled plans to slash $650 million in costs.

>Details of her potential departure, such as who might replace her, couldn’t be learned. Last month, the company said it would elevate director Ynon Kreiz, a former studio executive who joined the board last year, to the role of executive chairman.

>Mattel shares have fallen nearly 50% since Ms. Georgiadis took over, chopping its market value to just under $5 billion. The company’s annual sales have slipped below those of rival Hasbro Inc., which The Wall Street Journal reported last fall was exploring a potential takeover. It is unclear where those discussions currently stand.

>Mattel, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., and has 28,000 employees, has cycled through several leaders in recent years. A new CEO would be the fourth in four years. Like her predecessor, Ms. Georgiadis didn’t have experience in the toy business before taking the job.

>Ms. Georgiadis was recruited to join the toy maker in late 2016, as Mattel was signaling confidence in the looming holiday season. But Mattel’s inventories piled up at retailers and didn’t sell as expected, and the company had to cut prices to try to salvage the most critical period in the year. Sales and profits plunged as a result.

>Instead of inheriting a company on the upswing, by the time she joined after the holidays, Ms. Georgiadis found herself trying to stabilize what was then the world’s largest toy company.

>She continued to uncover more problems at Mattel. Before she arrived, Mattel leadership was trying to recoup more than $400 million in sales it lost when Hasbro took over a major Walt Disney Co. license tied to the “Frozen” movie and other princess dolls. But the slew of smaller products it turned to in an effort to close the gap added complexity and costs, and didn’t have lasting power. Some of Mattel’s other brands, like Monster High and American Girl, also slumped.

>Mattel continued to struggle last year as it tried to reduce excess inventory at retail and had to cope with the bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys “R” Us Inc., one of its biggest sales channels.

Technology -

Microsoft (MSFT): Stable growth over the past thirty something years, constantly competes with Apple and Google for market share. 

Google (GOOGL): Similarly, Google has held a large portion of the tech market along with making insane profits annually. As an added benefit, it has steadily grown and the only thing I can think of that's negative is the YouTube bots fiasco. 

Tesla (TSLA): This just out of fanboyism, I love Elon Musk. He's awesome. And, anyway, Tesla does civilian and governmental contracting, e.g selling cars to the public and solar panels to the government, etc. 

Gaming and eSports:

Activision Blizzard (ATVI): The world's leading video game publisher, also owns Overwatch of which I, and others, love. 

Riot Games (HKG: 0700): League of Legends is consistently one of the most watched game on Twitch and the tournaments for the game net millions. The industry can only grow too, us kids aren't just going to stop playing. 

Transportation:

Boeing (BA): Boeing is an unstoppable juggernaut. Airlines love them, people love them, and countries love them. They sell airplanes, rockets, satellites, all the cool stuff, and they own a huge percent of the aeronautics industry. They're unstoppable!

Pharmaceuticals:

AbbVie Inc (ABBV): Will eclipse $35bn by 2025, and, like JNJ, pays out good dividends. Revenue is growing very fast, with Wall Street believing ABBV will have a 16% annualized profit growth each year for the next five. That's pretty fast. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): While it did lose profit by losing its patent protection, it recently launched two new megablockbuster drugs of which are offsetting these losses. Might be fun to see how this stock does. 

Johnson and Johnson (JNJ): One of the best healthcare stocks, JNJ is growing faster than any other pharma corp and it yields an awesome dividend. 

Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND): Is a fast growing pharma corp that has a $2.9bn mid cap. Will also be interesting to see where this one goes. 

Index Funds:

Fidelity MSCI information Tech (FTEC): 27.49% annual returns according to USA News, and has $1.88bn worth of assets. 

Vanguard Information Technology (VGT): 27.5% annual returns, also according to USA News, and has $20.05bn worth of assets. 

Wall Street Bets:

Micron Techonology (MU): The stock goes up and down, up and down, just like my portfolio!

Nvidia (NVDA): Same reason as Micron. 

AMD (AMD): I'm an autist, alright? Leave me alone. 

Outside of stocks, I'd probably invest in some real estate in Delhi, Shanghai and/or Tokyo. Also, obviously, I'm joking about the r/wsb stuff. Anyways, what companies would you invest in? Why?

GPN05-03,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,8,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

“Think of strategic investments and M&A as playing a game of go,” said Mr. Tsai, the Alibaba executive vice chairman, at the investor conference last year. “In a game of go the strategic objective is to put your pieces on the chessboard and surround your opponent.”",0.69,"['their biggest tech companies are just ripoffs of us tech companies that operate solely in China.

> PG&E Corp. has been losing customers in tony Marin County north of San Francisco since 2010 to a new kind of rival, and says their growing popularity is costing the utility’s remaining customers, to the tune of $180 million last year. That could balloon to $500 million in the early 2020s, according to a statement Tuesday.

> California’s big three utilities are looking for ways to address this emerging issue. They helped make the state a clean-energy leader by striking some of the first big deals to buy wind and solar power. Problem is, those early contracts came with higher prices that were typically locked in for decades, and it’s costing them customers.

> The utilities are facing smaller local suppliers that are signing their own power-purchase deals at current, lower rates, and then siphoning off customers by passing on the discounts. At least 4.5 million California homes and businesses will be getting electricity from them by yearend, according to the California Community Choice Association, which represents these new power companies.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-proposes-reforms-support-160000811.html

> Also in 2002, California’s legislature authorized the formation of CCAs, allowing cities and counties to purchase and/or generate electricity for their residents and businesses. The first CCA began in PG&E’s service area in 2010. Likewise, customers can choose to receive their electricity from other third-party suppliers called Energy Service Providers (ESPs). For both CCA and ESP customers, PG&E continues to deliver the energy and provide meter reading, billing, maintenance and emergency response services.

> Today, communities that choose to implement CCA programs or customers that choose ESPs are responsible for the PCIA charge associated with energy resources procured on their behalf. PG&E does not make any money on the PCIA. The PCIA charge is required to ensure that all customers are treated equally and do not pay for other customers’ share of costs.

> However, the current PCIA formula has become unbalanced over time due to the growth of CCAs. **In 2017, CCA customers only paid approximately 65 percent of the costs associated with the energy resources procured on their behalf. This imbalance required PG&E customers who were not part of a CCA to pay approximately $180 million to subsidize CCA customers. Assuming this trend continues, in the early 2020s this amount is expected to grow to half a billion dollars, which is equal to the current PG&E low-income subsidy.**

TL;DR: The three major utility companies are stuck with old, expensive contracts, and are being undercut by cheaper competitors as a result.

>Mattel Inc. MAT Chief Executive Margaret “Margo” Georgiadis is in discussions to leave the toy maker, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be an abrupt exit at a company struggling with slumping sales and in the midst of a restructuring.

>The former Google executive, who joined Mattel in February 2017, has been unable to reverse the Barbie doll and Hot Wheels maker’s fortunes. She has overhauled Mattel’s management team, suspended its dividend and unveiled plans to slash $650 million in costs.

>Details of her potential departure, such as who might replace her, couldn’t be learned. Last month, the company said it would elevate director Ynon Kreiz, a former studio executive who joined the board last year, to the role of executive chairman.

>Mattel shares have fallen nearly 50% since Ms. Georgiadis took over, chopping its market value to just under $5 billion. The company’s annual sales have slipped below those of rival Hasbro Inc., which The Wall Street Journal reported last fall was exploring a potential takeover. It is unclear where those discussions currently stand.

>Mattel, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., and has 28,000 employees, has cycled through several leaders in recent years. A new CEO would be the fourth in four years. Like her predecessor, Ms. Georgiadis didn’t have experience in the toy business before taking the job.

>Ms. Georgiadis was recruited to join the toy maker in late 2016, as Mattel was signaling confidence in the looming holiday season. But Mattel’s inventories piled up at retailers and didn’t sell as expected, and the company had to cut prices to try to salvage the most critical period in the year. Sales and profits plunged as a result.

>Instead of inheriting a company on the upswing, by the time she joined after the holidays, Ms. Georgiadis found herself trying to stabilize what was then the world’s largest toy company.

>She continued to uncover more problems at Mattel. Before she arrived, Mattel leadership was trying to recoup more than $400 million in sales it lost when Hasbro took over a major Walt Disney Co. license tied to the “Frozen” movie and other princess dolls. But the slew of smaller products it turned to in an effort to close the gap added complexity and costs, and didn’t have lasting power. Some of Mattel’s other brands, like Monster High and American Girl, also slumped.

>Mattel continued to struggle last year as it tried to reduce excess inventory at retail and had to cope with the bankruptcy and liquidation of Toys “R” Us Inc., one of its biggest sales channels. Mattel’s sales fell 11% last year, its fourth-straight year of declines. The company reports its latest quarterly results next week.

Technology -

Microsoft (MSFT): Stable growth over the past thirty something years, constantly competes with Apple and Google for market share. 

Google (GOOGL): Similarly, Google has held a large portion of the tech market along with making insane profits annually. As an added benefit, it has steadily grown and the only thing I can think of that's negative is the YouTube bots fiasco. 

Tesla (TSLA): This just out of fanboyism, I love Elon Musk. He's awesome. And, anyway, Tesla does civilian and governmental contracting, e.g selling cars to the public and solar panels to the government, etc. 

Gaming and eSports:

Activision Blizzard (ATVI): The world's leading video game publisher, also owns Overwatch of which I, and others, love. 

Riot Games (HKG: 0700): League of Legends is consistently one of the most watched game on Twitch and the tournaments for the game net millions. The industry can only grow too, us kids aren't just going to stop playing. 

Transportation:

Boeing (BA): Boeing is an unstoppable juggernaut. Airlines love them, people love them, and countries love them. They sell airplanes, rockets, satellites, all the cool stuff, and they own a huge percent of the aeronautics industry. They're unstoppable!

Pharmaceuticals:

AbbVie Inc (ABBV): Will eclipse $35bn by 2025, and, like JNJ, pays out good dividends. Revenue is growing very fast, with Wall Street believing ABBV will have a 16% annualized profit growth each year for the next five. That's pretty fast. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): While it did lose profit by losing its patent protection, it recently launched two new megablockbuster drugs of which are offsetting these losses. Might be fun to see how this stock does. 

Johnson and Johnson (JNJ): One of the best healthcare stocks, JNJ is growing faster than any other pharma corp and it yields an awesome dividend. 

Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND): Is a fast growing pharma corp that has a $2.9bn mid cap. Will also be interesting to see where this one goes. 

Index Funds:

Fidelity MSCI information Tech (FTEC): 27.49% annual returns according to USA News, and has $1.88bn worth of assets. 

Vanguard Information Technology (VGT): 27.5% annual returns, also according to USA News, and has $20.05bn worth of assets. 

Wall Street Bets:

Micron Techonology (MU): The stock goes up and down, up and down, just like my portfolio!

Nvidia (NVDA): Same reason as Micron. 

AMD (AMD): I'm an autist, alright? Leave me alone.

> Grocery chains have long awaited the right conditions to charge more for their products, and a broad view of the U.S. would suggest this is their moment: Unemployment is near historic lows, consumer confidence is high and inflation is inching upward.

> But companies are finding they’re losing the power to hike prices. That’s because Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. are engaged in a battle to the death on consumer spending, while low-cost chains Aldi and Lidl pressure brick-and-mortar companies. At the same time, shoppers are becoming less loyal to legacy brand names than ever before -- meaning they’ll go generic instead of paying up for labels.

> “Retailers took advantage of lower food costs to push down prices, and customers became acclimated to that environment,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Now that inflation is returning, not only is competition in play, but customers are no longer used to seeing marginal price increases come through.”

> The forces at play are illustrated by General Mills Inc., which has acknowledged that attempted price hikes for its Progresso soup and Yoplait yogurt ultimately hurt sales. The misstep exacerbated a slump in those key businesses, as shoppers migrated to other brands. Nestle SA has also experienced difficulties in getting price increases to stick.

> It’s not just big food. Consumer companies are finding they’re being pinched by the same forces. Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc’s hygiene and home division, which sells brands such as Lysol spray and Air Wick air fresheners, showed solid volume gains in the most recent quarter, but suffered because of lower prices, sending its shares plummeting. Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies and Kleenex, reported flat or lower prices across its categories in its latest quarterly results.

> In the U.K., Tesco Plc and its competitors have started to push up prices to compensate for the post-Brexit weakening of the pound -- but it hasn’t been able to fully pass on higher costs to shoppers. In France, competition has prevented Carrefour SA and Casino Guichard Perrachon SA from implementing price hikes.

NWSA05-10,8byp4w,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,1523621833.0,7,7,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

AI Financing Boom
Both the U.S. and China are scrambling to fund startups in the key tech area of artificial-intelligence.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

“Think of strategic investments and M&A as playing a game of go,” said Mr. Tsai, the Alibaba executive vice chairman, at the investor conference last year. “In a game of go the strategic objective is to put your pieces on the chessboard and surround your opponent.”",0.69,"['their biggest tech companies are just ripoffs of us tech companies that operate solely in China.

GoPro Inc. jumped as much as 8.8 percent after a report said Chinese electronics maker Xiaomi Corp. has weighed whether to make an offer for the action-camera maker.

Chief Executive Officer Nick Woodman has said he is open to a deal and earlier this year the company hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. to advise it on a potential sale. Once valued at more than $10 billion, GoPro’s market capitalization has fallen to about $761 million. A buyer could leverage GoPro’s brand and gain profit contributions from device sales, analysts have said.

GoPro could potentially fetch $1 billion, The Information said, based on the price that Hewlett Packard paid for Palm, also a struggling electronics maker, in 2010. While Xiaomi has considered an offer, it doesn’t want to overpay, The Information said, citing a person familiar with the matter.

**Value Stocks** Caterpillar (CAT) is poised to deliver earnings per share growth of more than 30 percent this year according to a analysts, while the firm projects peak earnings of $16 per share four to five years from now. Currently priced at $150 the stock trades on a forward PE of less than ten. With Caterpillar's mining and construction markets around the world showing signs of a turnaround, thats a multiple that may appeal to value investors. 

Cemex (CX) is technically a Mexican cement company but with 50% of assets in the US and the financials based in dollars its about as American as almost any stock on the NYSE. The Mexican connection has held back CX as other construction companies have benefited from a strong US economy and increased Federal spending plans. But Merrill Lynch has said that all that political risk is more than priced in and that a weak dollar and strong growth in the US, Europe and the Philippines will ""drive strong earnings"". With the stock down 30% over the past year and a TTM PE of 12.9 it looks pretty cheap 

**Insider Buying** With the stock down nearly 40% DDR Corp (DDR) and yielding 10% director Alexander Otto has been snapping up stock with 7 purchases this year totaling about $40mn. Mr Otto is from the Otto dynasty that owns c.80 million square feet of U.S. office space and European shopping malls. His father Werner started the business back in 1949, so Alexander is well connected and, more importantly, seems comfortable enough with DDRs strategy and valuation to make numerous purchases in quick succession.

He’s not the only one, SumZero have given DDR a target price of $12 (compared to current stock price of $7.30). They are not the only contrarian investors out there supporting retail assets. Hedge funds and analysts are increasing beginning to realise that the demise of some retailers does not mean the end of retail malls and assets. Mall owners have shown ability to repurpose malls to bring in new retailers and reposition the real estate for new experiences such as movie theaters, child zones, and restaurants. That means that there is value and insiders, hedge funds and others are snapping up assets on the cheap.

**Growth Stocks** Solaredge Technologies (SEDG) has reported earnings growth of 40% for years so it’s not surprising that it trades on a lofty TTM PE of 30. In 2017 earnings grew 65% and SEDG Chairman and CEO, Guy Sella, said he was sure the company could maintain the trajectory of growth in 2018. The level of solar power generation is rising rapidly and the company has issued guidance for 70% sales growth in Q1 2018. With consensus 2018 estimates of $2.96, if the stock achieves that (reasonable) PE multiple of 30, it would see the stock rise an impressive 60% to $88.

DLH Holdings (DLHC) provides professional healthcare and public services to Government agencies and has seen steady exponential growth over the past 5 years. EBITDA has been growing by 100% annually. Looking ahead, management remain optimistic about the pipeline. In particular DLH, which offers drug and alcohol counseling services, could see expanded funding to fight opioid abuse. Given rapid growth the TTM PE of 16.8 and forward 2018 PE 12.5 looks very cheap. (please be aware this is a high risk microcap stock)

Technology -

Microsoft (MSFT): Stable growth over the past thirty something years, constantly competes with Apple and Google for market share. 

Google (GOOGL): Similarly, Google has held a large portion of the tech market along with making insane profits annually. As an added benefit, it has steadily grown and the only thing I can think of that's negative is the YouTube bots fiasco. 

Tesla (TSLA): This just out of fanboyism, I love Elon Musk. He's awesome. And, anyway, Tesla does civilian and governmental contracting, e.g selling cars to the public and solar panels to the government, etc. 

Gaming and eSports:

Activision Blizzard (ATVI): The world's leading video game publisher, also owns Overwatch of which I, and others, love. 

Riot Games (HKG: 0700): League of Legends is consistently one of the most watched game on Twitch and the tournaments for the game net millions. The industry can only grow too, us kids aren't just going to stop playing. 

Transportation:

Boeing (BA): Boeing is an unstoppable juggernaut. Airlines love them, people love them, and countries love them. They sell airplanes, rockets, satellites, all the cool stuff, and they own a huge percent of the aeronautics industry. They're unstoppable!

Pharmaceuticals:

AbbVie Inc (ABBV): Will eclipse $35bn by 2025, and, like JNJ, pays out good dividends. Revenue is growing very fast, with Wall Street believing ABBV will have a 16% annualized profit growth each year for the next five. That's pretty fast. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): While it did lose profit by losing its patent protection, it recently launched two new megablockbuster drugs of which are offsetting these losses. Might be fun to see how this stock does. 

Johnson and Johnson (JNJ): One of the best healthcare stocks, JNJ is growing faster than any other pharma corp and it yields an awesome dividend. 

Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND): Is a fast growing pharma corp that has a $2.9bn mid cap. Will also be interesting to see where this one goes. 

Index Funds:

Fidelity MSCI information Tech (FTEC): 27.49% annual returns according to USA News, and has $1.88bn worth of assets. 

Vanguard Information Technology (VGT): 27.5% annual returns, also according to USA News, and has $20.05bn worth of assets. 

Wall Street Bets:

Micron Techonology (MU): The stock goes up and down, up and down, just like my portfolio!

Nvidia (NVDA): Same reason as Micron. 

AMD (AMD): I'm an autist, alright? Leave me alone. 

Outside of stocks, I'd probably invest in some real estate in Delhi, Shanghai and/or Tokyo. Also, obviously, I'm joking about the r/wsb stuff. Anyways, what companies would you invest in? Why?

> Grocery chains have long awaited the right conditions to charge more for their products, and a broad view of the U.S. would suggest this is their moment: Unemployment is near historic lows, consumer confidence is high and inflation is inching upward.

> But companies are finding they’re losing the power to hike prices. That’s because Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. are engaged in a battle to the death on consumer spending, while low-cost chains Aldi and Lidl pressure brick-and-mortar companies. At the same time, shoppers are becoming less loyal to legacy brand names than ever before -- meaning they’ll go generic instead of paying up for labels.

> “Retailers took advantage of lower food costs to push down prices, and customers became acclimated to that environment,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Now that inflation is returning, not only is competition in play, but customers are no longer used to seeing marginal price increases come through.”

> The forces at play are illustrated by General Mills Inc., which has acknowledged that attempted price hikes for its Progresso soup and Yoplait yogurt ultimately hurt sales. The misstep exacerbated a slump in those key businesses, as shoppers migrated to other brands. Nestle SA has also experienced difficulties in getting price increases to stick.

> It’s not just big food. Consumer companies are finding they’re being pinched by the same forces. Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc’s hygiene and home division, which sells brands such as Lysol spray and Air Wick air fresheners, showed solid volume gains in the most recent quarter, but suffered because of lower prices, sending its shares plummeting. Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies and Kleenex, reported flat or lower prices across its categories in its latest quarterly results.

> In the U.K., Tesco Plc and its competitors have started to push up prices to compensate for the post-Brexit weakening of the pound -- but it hasn’t been able to fully pass on higher costs to shoppers. In France, competition has prevented Carrefour SA and Casino Guichard Perrachon SA from implementing price hikes.

The article also mentions about Aldi and Lidi expanding into the US. I also remember a Hormel engineer talking about the pressure to cut costs in the manufacturing area, and the challenges that go along with it.

The obliteration of ZOES is remarkable; I don't like investing in restaurants and haven't looked at the name but interesting that reviews can be as positive as they are (especially for Yelp reviews of a food chain) and the company can be a disasterous as it has been. Industry is going to continue to be effected by (and perhaps reshaped in some regards) by the massive demand for delivery.  "", ""I guess that's good food for thought.   I don't invest in them because I'm not really in tune with what is trendy, and many restaurants seem to run in fashion cycles almost like apparel, too easy to become a 'fashion victim' from forces beyond your control,or a market darling just from your sheer visibility.  Plus macro forces, etc.\n\nInvest in what you know.  If you know the field and are interested, still ways to make money.  "", ""I'd be careful about making blanket statements about overvaluation based on P/E as most restaurants tend to be domestic, and the new tax law has led to a lot of high P/E ratios due to tax charges.\n\nAnother note, Carroll's is a franchisee, while some of the other names are franchisors, so further analysis would be needed.\n\nI can't speak to the unprofitable brands.  Some, like Noodles & Co. Are laughably awful companies, but some of the other ones might have more nuanced situations."", 'Fuck, I wish I had gotten into that WING IPO....']"

MU06-20,8p5tqe,What’s your take on the current state of chips? Here’s mine.,1528330990.0,10,8,"I’m just going to focus on popular reddit chip stocks because I think as a group they paint a pretty good picture of the landscape. Obviously between Micron, Nvidia, AMD, and Intel there’s been a huge rally in the past month, but the outlook since the beginning of June seems to have shifted. Here’s what I’ve gathered from reports:

**Intel** has by far the highest market cap and is the most established, but, especially after the AMD showing of 7nm chips yesterday, it’s facing serious competition and looks to be falling behind. That said, they’ve been “falling behind” for a while now and they still consistently blowout earnings. Like Apple, even when they aren’t executing perfectly, they’re such a mainstay that it doesn’t usually show much in quarterly results.

**Micron** suffered a hit from a couple analyst downgrades last week, and is under investigation. Any sign of a slowdown in dram prices will send it back to the 40s and I’m worried it’s just gonna keep bouncing off 60 and then dump with people taking profits before the earnings report in a couple weeks. Still, the majority of analysts like it a lot. Like...a lot a lot. 

**Nvidia** announced that it will be a while before new gaming chips are produced, but also they’re best positioned to benefit from AI and cloud computing. The stock is very expensive. 

**AMD** is undervalued, but their stock price is historically fickle and they just had a huge run-up. I wish I had some and feel that it’s too late to buy after today since I’m thinking short term (6 months-year). 

**All chip companies** are at risk of being used as a bartering tool in the USA/China tariff negotiations, which puts them in a potentially precarious position. This could be the reason Micron and others are under investigation by China (leverage). 

All in all, I’m scared and am considering decreasing my large position in Micron. If I had AMD I’d keep that one. I’m keeping Nvidia. I dumped Intel in favor of micron and Nvidia a couple weeks ago (a little late to the party) because they have more room to grow and I suspect intel’s technology falling behind will catch up with them soon.

Does it sound like a good acquisition?",1527134781.0,6,2,"Kroger Co. is buying Home Chef, the largest private meal-kit company in the U.S. by sales, its second deal in as many weeks aimed at bolstering the supermarket chain's online business.

The deal -- $200 million initially and up to $700 million if Home Chef hits performance targets -- comes about a week after the Cincinnati-based grocer took a roughly $250 million stake in British online grocery operator Ocado Group PLC. The companies are poised to open a series of automated warehouses for grocery delivery in the U.S.

Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain by stores and sales, is quickly pushing to shake up its business model as its faces competition on all fronts. Amazon.com Inc. is ramping up delivery service and discounts at Whole Foods stores for Prime members, while Walmart Inc.'s investments in its stores and technology are paying off. Deep discounters, meanwhile, have pressured Kroger to slash costs as weak inflation in food prices haven't boosted sales as grocers had hoped.

TRV07-19,8wqq0n,Alaska Airlines Long Thesis,1530938941.0,28,28,"So I've seen a few post lately mentioning airlines around here and the other stock reddits and thought id share my brief pitch of going long on ALK from my reddit. Hopefully itll give yall something to consider. 

 Alaska Air Group Inc

**Alaska Air Lines**

NYSE:ALK

MktCp: 7.8B

**Core Business:** Alaska Air Group owns and operates Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, Horizon, McGee Air Services and some other smaller units. However I will focus on Alaska Airlines with consideration to the Virgin America acquisition since those are the biggest sources of revenue for the company. Most of their business comes from flights that transport customers to and from West coast destinations. However a significant percentage of their customers are connecting flights from West to Midwest/Atlantic

**Valuation:** Air Lines can be very tricky to put a price on. The business is very competitive and heavy on capital expenditures. Profit margins are consistently being brought down due to price matching other airlines. They naturally trade at low PE ratios. And historically have been value traps for investors. Therefore I proceed even more conservative than usual when constructing a DCF for this company. I assume that its free cash flow will grow 4&#37; on average for 5 years then reach terminal growth at 3 percent. This means some years it may lose fcf and others gain more than 4&#37; but I assume it will average out to 4&#37; yearly for the next five years. Using this I calculated a fair value of **$118 per share.** If my valuation is correct, ALK is very significantly undervalued.

**Competitive Advantage:** The commercial air line industry is all centered around offering the cheapest flights for customers and having small margins. Competitive advantages are usually either A) Niche Location or B) Brand Strength. I believe ALK has a strong case for both of these. The have a very significant presence in the West Coast having main flights going to Seattle to LA to Hawaii, even Costa Rica. The acquisition of Virgin America(although bad in the short term, more about it in risk section) will give them a greater share of the market in the region over the long term. Alaska Airlines has some of the best customer service and attention. They have had the highest customer satisfaction rate among airlines for 11 years straight(JD Power) and notable recent awards include best rewards program(Flyer talk 18), number 1 US Airline(Money 18),number 1 in Airline Quality Rating 2018, and ICCT Most fuel efficient Airline (2010-2017). I know some of these awards can be consider biased and some will say politics are involved but if you look at direct customer reviews of ALK and compare them to other regional airlines, its easy to tell that they have great customer satisfaction and its a priority to their business. To conclude I see ALK being a major player in a major market with an Amazon like focus on customer satisfactions.

**Risks:** Believe it or not, competition is not the biggest risk to Alaska Airlines. Oil prices and a recession are the biggest risks to Alaska Airlines as well as the airline industry. Oil prices make the biggest difference in profits for airlines companies. If oil continues to rise, airlines will have to raise ticket prices across the board. Higher tickets may impact the amount of customers willing to travel. If this happens and prices continue to rise, ALK's revenue,profits and FCF will take a hit. We have been in a bull run for 9 years(I argue less but won't talk about here) and its obvious we will hit a bear market eventually. Airlines are quite cyclical and a small recession will impact consumers spending. Much like oil prices, this will affect the revenue, profits and fcf for the company. They are also quite leveraged and higher interest rates could negatively effect their net income. A smaller risk is that the acquisition of Virgin America does not provide synergy causing investors to back out and lenders to be unwilling to give more money to ALK. The past 2 years have been rough. Alaska airline uses boeings while Virgin used Airbus which cause some operational issues. Management between the two took longer to become productive and internal politics became a bigger problem to solve than expected. This is clearly shown in the stocks lackluster performance over the past 2 years since the acquisition. While there maybe some rough road still ahead I believe management is becoming productive and the synergies will start to translate into earnings very soon.

**Dividend:** ALK currently pays a dividend of roughly 2&#37;. It is expected to hit 2.09&#37; next year. However I do not think it will grow significantly until after the synergies from the acquisition are realized.

**Future Trends**: Customer Service is more and more important as Americans have more money to spend. Considering the extremely low unemployment rates and the growth in spending power, It is reasonable to assume that Americans will choose to spend a little more to feel better. In this case it means paying a little extra for going from California to Seatle on ALK vs a budget ticket. IMO I think most customers will pay more for the satisfaction. As word of mouth continues to spread, more people will choose ALK over other West Coast airlines due to their strong brand and perks(free drinks!) The virgin acquisition strengthens their airport presence and with more hubs and more volume they should be able to lower prices while keeping their margins.

**Expectations:** Alaska Air Group stock is likely to continue its less than stellar growth this year. I personally have a price target of $70 by the end of 2018. Considering the summer months are the biggest for airlines, It has a possibility to get higher than $70 if they report significantly better than expected earnings for q2 q3. However we will have to wait until late this year, likely next year, for the earnings to stabilize and realize the synergies of Virgin acquisition. I have a price target of $100 by the end of 2019. And unless we have a bear market or considerably higher oil , I am confident in those targets. Although at they end of the day keep in mind they are just educated guesses and not accurate.

**Conclusion:** Alaska Air Group is a regional airline that has great brand strength as well as strong presence in their region. The stock has been lackluster due to some unexpected complications that arose when the acquisition of Virgin America took place. However I believe the complications have been solved and the power of the merger will start showing in the earnings soon. Due to the discount of intrinsic value to market price, as well as a decent 2&#37; dividend,ALK is a great 3-6 year hold with potential to double.

*Notes- Feel free to agree disagree , or even tear my analysis apart in the comments. Just keep it constructive and explain why. This is not a buy recommendation , rather its my opinion on the company.*

***Disclaimer- I am long ALK***",0.95,"[""I use to have Southwest and JetBlue. Made great gains from 2013-2015 but I'll never go back to airline stocks. Their stocks are effected by so many types of negative news whether it's about fuel prices, weather, trade wars, customer complaints on other airlines, overseas economies, a bad earnings report with a different stock negatively effecting yours...it's just too much. \n\nI believe a lot of airline stocks are currently undervalued and they keep building more cost effective planes that are always full of people...but the stocks still rarely trend up. Probably better off owning plane makers like Boeing instead. But even Boeing has taken a hit with all the tariff news this year. "", ""I want to play the short side for a second. ALK's biggest weakness is their scope. You mention they picked up VX to become a large West Coast provider and that there are synergies with the scope, but over 90% of their scope is still domestic even after the merger. This has its pros and cons but at the moment it's looking like a huge negative towards YoY growth. They have projected negative YoY revenue growth this upcoming quarter - along with every other domestic focused carrier. Airlines with more exposure abroad are doing stronger at the moment because international travel is up. Scope diversity is an ALK problem that the VX acquisition made worse. Also, airline customer service is a tough cookie to sell. Its been tried many times to differentiate on service in the airline industry but customers generally look at other factors like price, reliability, and connectivity over service. ALK has won a lot of awards but so has every other airline, the amount of awards given out to airlines is as ridiculous as the car industry. ALK's customer service differentiation is going to get harder to keep as they try to keep up with other airlines that are adding basic economy and buy ups which have proven to boost RASM and reduce CASM. They have already announced they are doing basic economy. As long as oil goes up, airlines will go down and vice versa"", 'Disclaimer I’m an amateur (at best) investor, but follow airlines quite closely. \n\nOne thing over the past year that definitely hurt Alaska’s profits was the ongoing pilot strike and shortage with Horizon Airlines. Horizon is a major feeder airline for Alaska and operates a ton of flights for them in smaller airports. Flight cancellations are an expensive proposition and this killed them for the first half of 2017. That was resolved but with a fairly substantial pay raise. The industry as a whole is going to have issues with the pilot shortage and I expect to see raises across all airlines. \n\nThe Virgin acquisition was a necessary move, but they also were forced to overpay as JetBlue also had a strong interest. Gaining airport slots, planes, and crews enabled them to grow significantly faster than they otherwise could have, but came with major challenges.  As you mentioned Alaska flies Boeing and Virgin Airbus, I think this will be a lingering issue for Alaska. Part of the business model that made Alaska so efficient and timely was having a single model of planes, B737. Sitting on a single model meant they didn’t have to deal with cross training employees or organizing the schedule around employees aircraft training, and sped up the time it took to ‘flip’ a plane, allowing for more flights in a day than legacy carriers could. IIRC Alaska and Southwest turn over planes on average close to 30 minutes as opposed to 1 hour by legacy airlines, which quickly adds up. Issues of crews timing out or cancelations due to sick or injured crew members are much easier to mitigate when all of your employees are interchangeable. This advantage was impaired by the addition of Virgin and their multiple Airbus models. The lease on those planes go until 2023 and they may need them all the way up to that point. \n\nAs far as long term views for Alaska, my biggest concern is competition with Southwest and expansions opportunities. Southwest expanding to Hawaii is going to cut down on the profitability on an already competitive market. Alaska has a considerable number of resources invested in Hawaii and has used that market to help fill many of its connecting flights in smaller markets. They also have to deal with Southwest expanding in California and challenging them for west coast supremacy. Southwest has been openly attacking them out west and targeting California customers in ways I’ve never see them do before. As you hit on, customer service is the hallmark for Alaska, and sets them apart from the legacy airlines. Anecdotally, people passionately love Alaska in a way I’ve not seen replicated for the legacy carriers. Unfortunately, Southwest also garners that same kind of enthusiasm. Their models are so similar that the advantage Alaska has when going head to head with a legacy carrier are mitigated versus Southwest. Lastly, I am unsure what expansion opportunities are available to Alaska. Slot restrictions at airports in the most desirable locations and the slow rate of airplane acquisition (slowed further by purchasing only one model) are significant hurdles to overcome. Going after the Midwest makes the most sense given their strength in the PNW, but taking on Delta in their home turf is a major undertaking. Expanding to the east coast or the south would involve setting up a hub there, which is an expensive proposition, in addition to taking on the legacy carriers established there. The southwest market means more time taking on Southwest. The best option to expand would mean another acquisition, The only two logical acquisitions would be Hawaiian airlines or JetBlue. Hawaiian would almost certainly be blocked, has even more route redundancy, and the same airplane issue. JetBlue, however, would be a perfect acquisition in terms of route network and business model. It does present the same issue of aircraft type that the Virgin acquisition did, however, at that point you could make an argument for having a primarily B737 fleet with a number of the A321 for specific routes. Unfortunately they are in absolutely no position financially to make that move. I hope that they are able to succeed, and agree in principal that they’re undervalued, with the merger and horizon strike tamping down profits last year, but I am not sure they can soar quite to the same heights (please excuse the metaphor, I couldn’t help myself)  you’re projecting. ', ""Not sure I agree that competition isn't a primary concern. Delta has really encroached into Seattle with new west coast and trans pacific routes. Even if Alaska still has a superior product, there's no way their yields haven't decreased because of this. Delta also has more leverage to gain lucrative corporate contracts. \n\nHowever, I do actually own the stock because imo the industry is severely under valued. Alaska, SW, and Delta are the best 3 managed airlines. Over the long term I think any of these 3 should have nice returns. "", 'In terms of growth, I think Alaska will have trouble competing directly with SW.  their target customers are the same and SW is the name brand.  Competition is good though, and if cheaper prices and better service are possible it will be good for all of us, shareholders included.\n\nTo challenge your assertion about well managed though: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sfgate.com/chris-mcginnis/amp/Alaska-Airlines-SFO-diversions-13004295.php\n\nNovelty is great, but even the threat of a bus trip in Bay Area traffic is enough for me to never fly Alaska again to SFO.  How a major policy change like this made it through upper management and even through PR leads me to wonder if this is just evidence that the company suffers from poor decision making at every level?', 'Can you do this sort of thing again but with another company? Fucking brilliant shit.', 'BTW The more detailed dcf price was around 110. I slightly mismeasured cashflow ', '>Due to the discount of intrinsic value to market price, as well as a decent 2% dividend\n\nWow a DCF that gives a $70 target **and a 2% dividend?!**']"

MSFT07-19,90i4mu,$AAPL a safer bet than $QQQ?,1532108852.0,12,0,"I know it sounds a little weird, but Apple's balance sheet and P/E are healthier than $QQQ (Nasdaq) as a whole.

MMM07-24,8zzxsb,Following the whales,1531951715.0,2,0,"Hi fellows,

For years I've been investing in stocks based on my own research; where I paid special attention to the product or service itself, instead of all the financial stuff...

So I thought by myself: Why shouldn't I just follow the whales, because they have done their research, and were positive  about it, right?

Without further ado, I started to analyze my first stock; using the website 'whalewisdom' ([https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ecyt](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ecyt) ) , I sorted on recent changes and found a new, big institutional owner. I was not sure if I interpreted everything correctly, so I grabbed a SEC filing (13G).

In the SEC filing I came to the conclusion that the amount of shares and the number of parties were larger than what my original source gave me. [http://investor.endocyte.com/node/12041/html](http://investor.endocyte.com/node/12041/html)  
At first it looks like the 5 parties all have 4.3 M shares, which seemed incorrect because 'whalewisdom' stated that there were only 2 parties with 4,3M shares. Then I found the following citation:

>These shares are owned directly as follows: (i) 3,059,616 shares of Common Stock held by VHCP II and (ii) 1,240,384 shares of Common Stock held by VHCP Co II. VHCP Management II is the general partner of VHCP II and the manager of VHCP Co II. Messrs. Koh and Shah are the managing members of VHCP Management II.

Which means the following...

**Name**                               **Number of shares:**

VHCP II                            3.059.616 (common stock)

VHCP Co II                      1.230.384 (common stock)    

**Name**                              **Governance**

VHCP II                              General partner: VHCP Management II

VHCP Co II                          Manager: VHCP Management II

VHCP Management         Managing members: Messrs. Koh & Shah

When I add up the number of stocks I came along the following total: 4.300.000, which is the half as stated on the website (where VHCP management II and VHCP II both have 4.3M shares). 

  
Could someone tell me if I'm wrong; and if so, what I do wrong; and where I possibly could have read it.

Thanks, I find the Reddit community really helpful!",0.5,"[""Because whales are big and cannot enter and exit positions as easily as you.\n\nBuffett can't just sell off a few hundred billion dollars in shares at a market peak even if he is sure they'll lose value""]"

T07-24,8wqq0n,Alaska Airlines Long Thesis,1530938941.0,28,29,"So I've seen a few post lately mentioning airlines around here and the other stock reddits and thought id share my brief pitch of going long on ALK from my reddit. Hopefully itll give yall something to consider. 

 Alaska Air Group Inc

**Alaska Air Lines**

NYSE:ALK

MktCp: 7.8B

**Core Business:** Alaska Air Group owns and operates Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, Horizon, McGee Air Services and some other smaller units. However I will focus on Alaska Airlines with consideration to the Virgin America acquisition since those are the biggest sources of revenue for the company. Most of their business comes from flights that transport customers to and from West coast destinations. However a significant percentage of their customers are connecting flights from West to Midwest/Atlantic

**Valuation:** Air Lines can be very tricky to put a price on. The business is very competitive and heavy on capital expenditures. Profit margins are consistently being brought down due to price matching other airlines. They naturally trade at low PE ratios. And historically have been value traps for investors. Therefore I proceed even more conservative than usual when constructing a DCF for this company. I assume that its free cash flow will grow 4&#37; on average for 5 years then reach terminal growth at 3 percent. This means some years it may lose fcf and others gain more than 4&#37; but I assume it will average out to 4&#37; yearly for the next five years. Using this I calculated a fair value of **$118 per share.** If my valuation is correct, ALK is very significantly undervalued.

**Competitive Advantage:** The commercial air line industry is all centered around offering the cheapest flights for customers and having small margins. Competitive advantages are usually either A) Niche Location or B) Brand Strength. I believe ALK has a strong case for both of these. The have a very significant presence in the West Coast having main flights going to Seattle to LA to Hawaii, even Costa Rica. The acquisition of Virgin America(although bad in the short term, more about it in risk section) will give them a greater share of the market in the region over the long term. Alaska Airlines has some of the best customer service and attention. They have had the highest customer satisfaction rate among airlines for 11 years straight(JD Power) and notable recent awards include best rewards program(Flyer talk 18), number 1 US Airline(Money 18),number 1 in Airline Quality Rating 2018, and ICCT Most fuel efficient Airline (2010-2017). I know some of these awards can be consider biased and some will say politics are involved but if you look at direct customer reviews of ALK and compare them to other regional airlines, its easy to tell that they have great customer satisfaction and its a priority to their business. To conclude I see ALK being a major player in a major market with an Amazon like focus on customer satisfactions.

**Risks:** Believe it or not, competition is not the biggest risk to Alaska Airlines. Oil prices and a recession are the biggest risks to Alaska Airlines as well as the airline industry. Oil prices make the biggest difference in profits for airlines companies. If oil continues to rise, airlines will have to raise ticket prices across the board. Higher tickets may impact the amount of customers willing to travel. If this happens and prices continue to rise, ALK's revenue,profits and FCF will take a hit. We have been in a bull run for 9 years(I argue less but won't talk about here) and its obvious we will hit a bear market eventually. Airlines are quite cyclical and a small recession will impact consumers spending. Much like oil prices, this will affect the revenue, profits and fcf for the company. They are also quite leveraged and higher interest rates could negatively effect their net income. A smaller risk is that the acquisition of Virgin America does not provide synergy causing investors to back out and lenders to be unwilling to give more money to ALK. The past 2 years have been rough. Alaska airline uses boeings while Virgin used Airbus which cause some operational issues. Management between the two took longer to become productive and internal politics became a bigger problem to solve than expected. This is clearly shown in the stocks lackluster performance over the past 2 years since the acquisition. While there maybe some rough road still ahead I believe management is becoming productive and the synergies will start to translate into earnings very soon.

**Dividend:** ALK currently pays a dividend of roughly 2&#37;. It is expected to hit 2.09&#37; next year. However I do not think it will grow significantly until after the synergies from the acquisition are realized.

**Future Trends**: Customer Service is more and more important as Americans have more money to spend. Considering the extremely low unemployment rates and the growth in spending power, It is reasonable to assume that Americans will choose to spend a little more to feel better. In this case it means paying a little extra for going from California to Seatle on ALK vs a budget ticket. IMO I think most customers will pay more for the satisfaction. As word of mouth continues to spread, more people will choose ALK over other West Coast airlines due to their strong brand and perks(free drinks!) The virgin acquisition strengthens their airport presence and with more hubs and more volume they should be able to lower prices while keeping their margins.

**Expectations:** Alaska Air Group stock is likely to continue its less than stellar growth this year. I personally have a price target of $70 by the end of 2018. Considering the summer months are the biggest for airlines, It has a possibility to get higher than $70 if they report significantly better than expected earnings for q2 q3. However we will have to wait until late this year, likely next year, for the earnings to stabilize and realize the synergies of Virgin acquisition. I have a price target of $100 by the end of 2019. And unless we have a bear market or considerably higher oil , I am confident in those targets. Although at they end of the day keep in mind they are just educated guesses and not accurate.

**Conclusion:** Alaska Air Group is a regional airline that has great brand strength as well as strong presence in their region. The stock has been lackluster due to some unexpected complications that arose when the acquisition of Virgin America took place. However I believe the complications have been solved and the power of the merger will start showing in the earnings soon. Due to the discount of intrinsic value to market price, as well as a decent 2&#37; dividend,ALK is a great 3-6 year hold with potential to double.

*Notes- Feel free to agree disagree , or even tear my analysis apart in the comments. Just keep it constructive and explain why. This is not a buy recommendation , rather its my opinion on the company.*

***Disclaimer- I am long ALK***",0.93,"[""I use to have Southwest and JetBlue. Made great gains from 2013-2015 but I'll never go back to airline stocks. Their stocks are effected by so many types of negative news whether it's about fuel prices, weather, trade wars, customer complaints on other airlines, overseas economies, a bad earnings report with a different stock negatively effecting yours...it's just too much. \n\nI believe a lot of airline stocks are currently undervalued and they keep building more cost effective planes that are always full of people...but the stocks still rarely trend up. Probably better off owning plane makers like Boeing instead. But even Boeing has taken a hit with all the tariff news this year. "", ""I want to play the short side for a second. ALK's biggest weakness is their scope. You mention they picked up VX to become a large West Coast provider and that there are synergies with the scope, but over 90% of their scope is still domestic even after the merger. This has its pros and cons but at the moment it's looking like a huge negative towards YoY growth. They have projected negative YoY revenue growth this upcoming quarter - along with every other domestic focused carrier. Airlines with more exposure abroad are doing stronger at the moment because international travel is up. Scope diversity is an ALK problem that the VX acquisition made worse. Also, airline customer service is a tough cookie to sell. Its been tried many times to differentiate on service in the airline industry but customers generally look at other factors like price, reliability, and connectivity over service. ALK has won a lot of awards but so has every other airline, the amount of awards given out to airlines is as ridiculous as the car industry. ALK's customer service differentiation is going to get harder to keep as they try to keep up with other airlines that are adding basic economy and buy ups which have proven to boost RASM and reduce CASM. They have already announced they are doing basic economy. As long as oil goes up, airlines will go down and vice versa"", 'Disclaimer I’m an amateur (at best) investor, but follow airlines quite closely. \n\nOne thing over the past year that definitely hurt Alaska’s profits was the ongoing pilot strike and shortage with Horizon Airlines. Horizon is a major feeder airline for Alaska and operates a ton of flights for them in smaller airports. Flight cancellations are an expensive proposition and this killed them for the first half of 2017. That was resolved but with a fairly substantial pay raise. The industry as a whole is going to have issues with the pilot shortage and I expect to see raises across all airlines. \n\nThe Virgin acquisition was a necessary move, but they also were forced to overpay as JetBlue also had a strong interest. Gaining airport slots, planes, and crews enabled them to grow significantly faster than they otherwise could have, but came with major challenges.  As you mentioned Alaska flies Boeing and Virgin Airbus, I think this will be a lingering issue for Alaska. Part of the business model that made Alaska so efficient and timely was having a single model of planes, B737. Sitting on a single model meant they didn’t have to deal with cross training employees or organizing the schedule around employees aircraft training, and sped up the time it took to ‘flip’ a plane, allowing for more flights in a day than legacy carriers could. IIRC Alaska and Southwest turn over planes on average close to 30 minutes as opposed to 1 hour by legacy airlines, which quickly adds up. Issues of crews timing out or cancelations due to sick or injured crew members are much easier to mitigate when all of your employees are interchangeable. This advantage was impaired by the addition of Virgin and their multiple Airbus models. The lease on those planes go until 2023 and they may need them all the way up to that point. \n\nAs far as long term views for Alaska, my biggest concern is competition with Southwest and expansions opportunities. Southwest expanding to Hawaii is going to cut down on the profitability on an already competitive market. Alaska has a considerable number of resources invested in Hawaii and has used that market to help fill many of its connecting flights in smaller markets. They also have to deal with Southwest expanding in California and challenging them for west coast supremacy. Southwest has been openly attacking them out west and targeting California customers in ways I’ve never see them do before. As you hit on, customer service is the hallmark for Alaska, and sets them apart from the legacy airlines. Anecdotally, people passionately love Alaska in a way I’ve not seen replicated for the legacy carriers. Unfortunately, Southwest also garners that same kind of enthusiasm. Their models are so similar that the advantage Alaska has when going head to head with a legacy carrier are mitigated versus Southwest. Lastly, I am unsure what expansion opportunities are available to Alaska. Slot restrictions at airports in the most desirable locations and the slow rate of airplane acquisition (slowed further by purchasing only one model) are significant hurdles to overcome. Going after the Midwest makes the most sense given their strength in the PNW, but taking on Delta in their home turf is a major undertaking. Expanding to the east coast or the south would involve setting up a hub there, which is an expensive proposition, in addition to taking on the legacy carriers established there. The southwest market means more time taking on Southwest. The best option to expand would mean another acquisition, The only two logical acquisitions would be Hawaiian airlines or JetBlue. Hawaiian would almost certainly be blocked, has even more route redundancy, and the same airplane issue. JetBlue, however, would be a perfect acquisition in terms of route network and business model. It does present the same issue of aircraft type that the Virgin acquisition did, however, at that point you could make an argument for having a primarily B737 fleet with a number of the A321 for specific routes. Unfortunately they are in absolutely no position financially to make that move. I hope that they are able to succeed, and agree in principal that they’re undervalued, with the merger and horizon strike tamping down profits last year, but I am not sure they can soar quite to the same heights (please excuse the metaphor, I couldn’t help myself)  you’re projecting. ', ""Not sure I agree that competition isn't a primary concern. Delta has really encroached into Seattle with new west coast and trans pacific routes. Even if Alaska still has a superior product, there's no way their yields haven't decreased because of this. Delta also has more leverage to gain lucrative corporate contracts. \n\nHowever, I do actually own the stock because imo the industry is severely under valued. Alaska, SW, and Delta are the best 3 managed airlines. Over the long term I think any of these 3 should have nice returns. "", 'In terms of growth, I think Alaska will have trouble competing directly with SW.  their target customers are the same and SW is the name brand.  Competition is good though, and if cheaper prices and better service are possible it will be good for all of us, shareholders included.\n\nTo challenge your assertion about well managed though: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sfgate.com/chris-mcginnis/amp/Alaska-Airlines-SFO-diversions-13004295.php\n\nNovelty is great, but even the threat of a bus trip in Bay Area traffic is enough for me to never fly Alaska again to SFO.  How a major policy change like this made it through upper management and even through PR leads me to wonder if this is just evidence that the company suffers from poor decision making at every level?', 'Can you do this sort of thing again but with another company? Fucking brilliant shit.', 'BTW The more detailed dcf price was around 110. I slightly mismeasured cashflow ', '>Due to the discount of intrinsic value to market price, as well as a decent 2% dividend\n\nWow a DCF that gives a $70 target **and a 2% dividend?!**']"

Or, it could just be that Omnicom's domestic clients are not seeing as much value in traditional market spend, especially with the rise of nontraditional technology-based advertising competitors.

>Omnicom also faces competition from consulting firms such as Accenture (ACN.N), IBM (IBM.N) and Deloitte, which have built big marketing businesses in recent years through acquisitions.

Perhaps its just that these advertising agencies are finding themselves playing catchup to other data-driven advertisers.

>Omnicom last week rolled out its data driven marketing and insights platform - Omni, aiming to battle the rise of internet giants Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O), which have transformed the sector by using data to better target advertising.

Competitor Interpublic announced the acquisition of data mining firm Acxiom Corp’s marketing solutions business just two weeks ago.

AMZN07-26,8vd0g5,Amazon could be heading for a plateau—but here's what could help it get over the hump,1530478628.0,5,6,"[Source CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/16/amazon-may-be-hitting-a-peak-but-going-international-may-boost-prime.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain)

Amazon can seemingly  do no wrong, with the company constantly disrupting major industries,  and consumers increasingly integrating its offerings into every aspect  of their daily lives.

Just this week, [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) sent pharmacy stocks reeling after it [announced it was buying online pharmacy PillPack](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/28/walgreens-cvs-shares-tank-after-amazon-buys-online-pharmacy-pillpack.html).  The market’s reaction underscored how Amazon’s entry into key sectors  leaves the competition scrambling to adjust, and increased speculation  that the retail giant is poised to upend yet another industry.

“This acquisition could  be the launchpad for the long-feared broader entry of Amazon into retail  pharmacy space, just months after news reports had brought some relief  that Amazon was not ready yet to enter drug distribution,” Evercore ISI  told its clients in a research note Thursday.

By all appearances, the  Amazon juggernaut can’t be slowed. However, a recent report suggests  Amazon's growth may actually be reaching a plateau — creating a  potential opening for competitors trying to bring the behemoth down.

According to data from  RBC’s latest online shopping survey, Amazon Prime membership growth is  showing signs of slowing down. At 55 percent, just over half of the U.S.  is subscribed to Prime, Amazon’s recurring subscription service, RBC  said — a level consistent with 2017’s figures.

""This was the first year  when Prime penetration didn't rise. A surprising result, which implies  Prime expansion is likely mostly/totally driven by international  markets,"" said Mark Mahaney, RBC's lead internet analyst.

To be sure, Amazon remains the retailer to beat, even though it [hiked the Prime membership price by 20 percent in May](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/26/amazon-will-increase-the-price-of-its-annual-prime-plan-effective-may-1.html)  to $119. Immediately after, the stock hit new highs as investors bet on  Amazon maintaining its lead with consumers and the competition.

However, RBC’s data underscore how potentially slowing growth in the U.S. could undermine [Amazon’s “flywheel” effect](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-1-principle-jeff-bezos-and-amazon-follow-to-fuel-incredible-growth.html)  — a bet that lower prices and membership perks will draw in more  customers — and lead to more Prime-eligible items and sellers. That  virtuous cycle makes Prime more valuable, and attracts ever more  subscribers.

#### Going abroad

The PillPack deal will give Amazon a toehold in  pharmaceuticals, an area that’s proven resistant to low prices and  disruption. Analysts speculate that Amazon may shoehorn the online  pharmacy into a new offering for Prime subscriptions.

Currently, $119 buys  Prime members access to Amazon Video, Amazon Music, discounts at Whole  Foods, as well as faster shipping and delivery. However, RBC stated  Amazon may need even more to lure in new Prime subscribers, and hold  current members.

For that reason, some  analysts suggest Prime may need to look abroad for more growth. For now,  Amazon’s premier subscription is available in India, Southeast Asia,  Latin America, Japan and Australia.

“International is the  biggest Prime opportunity, and could over the next five years reach 25  to 35 million people from 8 million currently,” said Gene Munster,  managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures. He cited growing  international brand awareness, along with new countries adding Prime,  boosting his projections.  

Amazon has been adding to  its Prime offerings across retail, delivery and video, but data suggest  members may not be using all the offerings available with a  subscription. A new survey by Morgan Stanley shows that only 1 out of 3  Prime members actually uses Amazon's streaming video service.

Nevertheless, Amazon’s  customers appear deeply loyal to the retail giant. The company adds  value by selling retail goods cheaply, and sometimes at aggressively  steep discounts. It introduces new competing products, and offers  private label options.

Guru Hariharan, CEO of  Boomerang Commerce, a company that helps retailers like Target and  Kohl's compete with Amazon, told CNBC that his firm noticed that few  shoppers compare prices while shopping on Amazon — meaning they have  complete trust that they can’t get goods more cheaply elsewhere.

It’s how Amazon has  managed to gobble up 20 percent of the U.S. online retail market,  according to RBC. Still, with its ease of use and rapid delivery, most  analysts believe Amazon will continue gaining market share, despite  fears of its growth topping out.

“First, more Prime items  and Prime video will attract and retain members,” said Loup’s Munster.  “Second, there are still about 15 million homes in the U.S. that don’t  have internet. As they slowly get online, Prime members slowly grow.”",0.69,"[""Bigger you get, harder it is to grow. Takes a massive amount of money buying AMZN stock just to keep the share price where it is. We're kind of in virgin territory with several stocks up around three quarter trillion in valuation, and what that means for their future share price growth. I'm sure some crusty old farts said the same thing about the first billion dollar market caps back in the day, but even so, when I am looking for growth, I am not looking so much at something that is already valued near a trillion dollars. This is nothing to do with the company itself. It may be great, it may not be. I'm just talking about the stock."", '>According to data from RBC’s latest online shopping survey, Amazon Prime membership growth is showing signs of slowing down. At 55 percent, just over half of the U.S. is subscribed to Prime, Amazon’s recurring subscription service, RBC said — a level consistent with 2017’s figures.\n\nthis is just silly. There is no credibility that Amazon stock growth is directly tied to prime membership numbers, especially when a lot of the valuation is lead by AWS. ', 'Looking at the many moves Amazon made the past few months, they seems to be findings new businesses to expand. There are still room for growth and I doubt plateau will happen within the next 2 years or so.', ""Amazon has plateaued.  Unless it hasn't.  So, up or down from here then?""]"
AAL07-26,8wqq0n,Alaska Airlines Long Thesis,1530938941.0,28,28,"So I've seen a few post lately mentioning airlines around here and the other stock reddits and thought id share my brief pitch of going long on ALK from my reddit. Hopefully itll give yall something to consider. 

 Alaska Air Group Inc

**Alaska Air Lines**

NYSE:ALK

MktCp: 7.8B

**Core Business:** Alaska Air Group owns and operates Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, Horizon, McGee Air Services and some other smaller units. However I will focus on Alaska Airlines with consideration to the Virgin America acquisition since those are the biggest sources of revenue for the company. Most of their business comes from flights that transport customers to and from West coast destinations. However a significant percentage of their customers are connecting flights from West to Midwest/Atlantic

**Valuation:** Air Lines can be very tricky to put a price on. The business is very competitive and heavy on capital expenditures. Profit margins are consistently being brought down due to price matching other airlines. They naturally trade at low PE ratios. And historically have been value traps for investors. Therefore I proceed even more conservative than usual when constructing a DCF for this company. I assume that its free cash flow will grow 4&#37; on average for 5 years then reach terminal growth at 3 percent. This means some years it may lose fcf and others gain more than 4&#37; but I assume it will average out to 4&#37; yearly for the next five years. Using this I calculated a fair value of **$118 per share.** If my valuation is correct, ALK is very significantly undervalued.

**Competitive Advantage:** The commercial air line industry is all centered around offering the cheapest flights for customers and having small margins. Competitive advantages are usually either A) Niche Location or B) Brand Strength. I believe ALK has a strong case for both of these. The have a very significant presence in the West Coast having main flights going to Seattle to LA to Hawaii, even Costa Rica. The acquisition of Virgin America(although bad in the short term, more about it in risk section) will give them a greater share of the market in the region over the long term. Alaska Airlines has some of the best customer service and attention. They have had the highest customer satisfaction rate among airlines for 11 years straight(JD Power) and notable recent awards include best rewards program(Flyer talk 18), number 1 US Airline(Money 18),number 1 in Airline Quality Rating 2018, and ICCT Most fuel efficient Airline (2010-2017). I know some of these awards can be consider biased and some will say politics are involved but if you look at direct customer reviews of ALK and compare them to other regional airlines, its easy to tell that they have great customer satisfaction and its a priority to their business. To conclude I see ALK being a major player in a major market with an Amazon like focus on customer satisfactions.

**Risks:** Believe it or not, competition is not the biggest risk to Alaska Airlines. Oil prices and a recession are the biggest risks to Alaska Airlines as well as the airline industry. Oil prices make the biggest difference in profits for airlines companies. If oil continues to rise, airlines will have to raise ticket prices across the board. Higher tickets may impact the amount of customers willing to travel. If this happens and prices continue to rise, ALK's revenue,profits and FCF will take a hit. We have been in a bull run for 9 years(I argue less but won't talk about here) and its obvious we will hit a bear market eventually. Airlines are quite cyclical and a small recession will impact consumers spending. Much like oil prices, this will affect the revenue, profits and fcf for the company. They are also quite leveraged and higher interest rates could negatively effect their net income. A smaller risk is that the acquisition of Virgin America does not provide synergy causing investors to back out and lenders to be unwilling to give more money to ALK. The past 2 years have been rough. Alaska airline uses boeings while Virgin used Airbus which cause some operational issues. Management between the two took longer to become productive and internal politics became a bigger problem to solve than expected. This is clearly shown in the stocks lackluster performance over the past 2 years since the acquisition. While there maybe some rough road still ahead I believe management is becoming productive and the synergies will start to translate into earnings very soon.

**Dividend:** ALK currently pays a dividend of roughly 2&#37;. It is expected to hit 2.09&#37; next year. However I do not think it will grow significantly until after the synergies from the acquisition are realized.

**Future Trends**: Customer Service is more and more important as Americans have more money to spend. Considering the extremely low unemployment rates and the growth in spending power, It is reasonable to assume that Americans will choose to spend a little more to feel better. In this case it means paying a little extra for going from California to Seatle on ALK vs a budget ticket. IMO I think most customers will pay more for the satisfaction. As word of mouth continues to spread, more people will choose ALK over other West Coast airlines due to their strong brand and perks(free drinks!) The virgin acquisition strengthens their airport presence and with more hubs and more volume they should be able to lower prices while keeping their margins.

**Expectations:** Alaska Air Group stock is likely to continue its less than stellar growth this year. I personally have a price target of $70 by the end of 2018. Considering the summer months are the biggest for airlines, It has a possibility to get higher than $70 if they report significantly better than expected earnings for q2 q3. However we will have to wait until late this year, likely next year, for the earnings to stabilize and realize the synergies of Virgin acquisition. I have a price target of $100 by the end of 2019. And unless we have a bear market or considerably higher oil , I am confident in those targets. Although at they end of the day keep in mind they are just educated guesses and not accurate.

**Conclusion:** Alaska Air Group is a regional airline that has great brand strength as well as strong presence in their region. The stock has been lackluster due to some unexpected complications that arose when the acquisition of Virgin America took place. However I believe the complications have been solved and the power of the merger will start showing in the earnings soon. Due to the discount of intrinsic value to market price, as well as a decent 2&#37; dividend,ALK is a great 3-6 year hold with potential to double.

*Notes- Feel free to agree disagree , or even tear my analysis apart in the comments. Just keep it constructive and explain why. This is not a buy recommendation , rather its my opinion on the company.*

***Disclaimer- I am long ALK***",0.93,"[""I use to have Southwest and JetBlue. Made great gains from 2013-2015 but I'll never go back to airline stocks. Their stocks are effected by so many types of negative news whether it's about fuel prices, weather, trade wars, customer complaints on other airlines, overseas economies, a bad earnings report with a different stock negatively effecting yours...it's just too much. \n\nI believe a lot of airline stocks are currently undervalued and they keep building more cost effective planes that are always full of people...but the stocks still rarely trend up. Probably better off owning plane makers like Boeing instead. But even Boeing has taken a hit with all the tariff news this year. "", ""I want to play the short side for a second. ALK's biggest weakness is their scope. You mention they picked up VX to become a large West Coast provider and that there are synergies with the scope, but over 90% of their scope is still domestic even after the merger. This has its pros and cons but at the moment it's looking like a huge negative towards YoY growth. They have projected negative YoY revenue growth this upcoming quarter - along with every other domestic focused carrier. Airlines with more exposure abroad are doing stronger at the moment because international travel is up. Scope diversity is an ALK problem that the VX acquisition made worse. Also, airline customer service is a tough cookie to sell. Its been tried many times to differentiate on service in the airline industry but customers generally look at other factors like price, reliability, and connectivity over service. ALK has won a lot of awards but so has every other airline, the amount of awards given out to airlines is as ridiculous as the car industry. ALK's customer service differentiation is going to get harder to keep as they try to keep up with other airlines that are adding basic economy and buy ups which have proven to boost RASM and reduce CASM. They have already announced they are doing basic economy. As long as oil goes up, airlines will go down and vice versa"", 'Disclaimer I’m an amateur (at best) investor, but follow airlines quite closely. \n\nOne thing over the past year that definitely hurt Alaska’s profits was the ongoing pilot strike and shortage with Horizon Airlines. Horizon is a major feeder airline for Alaska and operates a ton of flights for them in smaller airports. Flight cancellations are an expensive proposition and this killed them for the first half of 2017. That was resolved but with a fairly substantial pay raise. The industry as a whole is going to have issues with the pilot shortage and I expect to see raises across all airlines. \n\nThe Virgin acquisition was a necessary move, but they also were forced to overpay as JetBlue also had a strong interest. Gaining airport slots, planes, and crews enabled them to grow significantly faster than they otherwise could have, but came with major challenges.  As you mentioned Alaska flies Boeing and Virgin Airbus, I think this will be a lingering issue for Alaska. Part of the business model that made Alaska so efficient and timely was having a single model of planes, B737. Sitting on a single model meant they didn’t have to deal with cross training employees or organizing the schedule around employees aircraft training, and sped up the time it took to ‘flip’ a plane, allowing for more flights in a day than legacy carriers could. IIRC Alaska and Southwest turn over planes on average close to 30 minutes as opposed to 1 hour by legacy airlines, which quickly adds up. Issues of crews timing out or cancelations due to sick or injured crew members are much easier to mitigate when all of your employees are interchangeable. This advantage was impaired by the addition of Virgin and their multiple Airbus models. The lease on those planes go until 2023 and they may need them all the way up to that point. \n\nAs far as long term views for Alaska, my biggest concern is competition with Southwest and expansions opportunities. Southwest expanding to Hawaii is going to cut down on the profitability on an already competitive market. Alaska has a considerable number of resources invested in Hawaii and has used that market to help fill many of its connecting flights in smaller markets. They also have to deal with Southwest expanding in California and challenging them for west coast supremacy. Southwest has been openly attacking them out west and targeting California customers in ways I’ve never see them do before. As you hit on, customer service is the hallmark for Alaska, and sets them apart from the legacy airlines. Anecdotally, people passionately love Alaska in a way I’ve not seen replicated for the legacy carriers. Unfortunately, Southwest also garners that same kind of enthusiasm. Their models are so similar that the advantage Alaska has when going head to head with a legacy carrier are mitigated versus Southwest. Lastly, I am unsure what expansion opportunities are available to Alaska. Slot restrictions at airports in the most desirable locations and the slow rate of airplane acquisition (slowed further by purchasing only one model) are significant hurdles to overcome. Going after the Midwest makes the most sense given their strength in the PNW, but taking on Delta in their home turf is a major undertaking. Expanding to the east coast or the south would involve setting up a hub there, which is an expensive proposition, in addition to taking on the legacy carriers established there. The southwest market means more time taking on Southwest. The best option to expand would mean another acquisition, The only two logical acquisitions would be Hawaiian airlines or JetBlue. Hawaiian would almost certainly be blocked, has even more route redundancy, and the same airplane issue. JetBlue, however, would be a perfect acquisition in terms of route network and business model. It does present the same issue of aircraft type that the Virgin acquisition did, however, at that point you could make an argument for having a primarily B737 fleet with a number of the A321 for specific routes. Unfortunately they are in absolutely no position financially to make that move. I hope that they are able to succeed, and agree in principal that they’re undervalued, with the merger and horizon strike tamping down profits last year, but I am not sure they can soar quite to the same heights (please excuse the metaphor, I couldn’t help myself)  you’re projecting.

ALK07-26,8wqq0n,Alaska Airlines Long Thesis,1530938941.0,28,28,"So I've seen a few post lately mentioning airlines around here and the other stock reddits and thought id share my brief pitch of going long on ALK from my reddit. Hopefully itll give yall something to consider. 

 Alaska Air Group Inc

**Alaska Air Lines**

NYSE:ALK

MktCp: 7.8B

**Core Business:** Alaska Air Group owns and operates Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, Horizon, McGee Air Services and some other smaller units. However I will focus on Alaska Airlines with consideration to the Virgin America acquisition since those are the biggest sources of revenue for the company. Most of their business comes from flights that transport customers to and from West coast destinations. However a significant percentage of their customers are connecting flights from West to Midwest/Atlantic

**Valuation:** Air Lines can be very tricky to put a price on. The business is very competitive and heavy on capital expenditures. Profit margins are consistently being brought down due to price matching other airlines. They naturally trade at low PE ratios. And historically have been value traps for investors. Therefore I proceed even more conservative than usual when constructing a DCF for this company. I assume that its free cash flow will grow 4&#37; on average for 5 years then reach terminal growth at 3 percent. This means some years it may lose fcf and others gain more than 4&#37; but I assume it will average out to 4&#37; yearly for the next five years. Using this I calculated a fair value of **$118 per share.** If my valuation is correct, ALK is very significantly undervalued.

**Competitive Advantage:** The commercial air line industry is all centered around offering the cheapest flights for customers and having small margins. Competitive advantages are usually either A) Niche Location or B) Brand Strength. I believe ALK has a strong case for both of these. The have a very significant presence in the West Coast having main flights going to Seattle to LA to Hawaii, even Costa Rica. The acquisition of Virgin America(although bad in the short term, more about it in risk section) will give them a greater share of the market in the region over the long term. Alaska Airlines has some of the best customer service and attention. They have had the highest customer satisfaction rate among airlines for 11 years straight(JD Power) and notable recent awards include best rewards program(Flyer talk 18), number 1 US Airline(Money 18),number 1 in Airline Quality Rating 2018, and ICCT Most fuel efficient Airline (2010-2017). I know some of these awards can be consider biased and some will say politics are involved but if you look at direct customer reviews of ALK and compare them to other regional airlines, its easy to tell that they have great customer satisfaction and its a priority to their business. To conclude I see ALK being a major player in a major market with an Amazon like focus on customer satisfactions.

**Risks:** Believe it or not, competition is not the biggest risk to Alaska Airlines. Oil prices and a recession are the biggest risks to Alaska Airlines as well as the airline industry. Oil prices make the biggest difference in profits for airlines companies. If oil continues to rise, airlines will have to raise ticket prices across the board. Higher tickets may impact the amount of customers willing to travel. If this happens and prices continue to rise, ALK's revenue,profits and FCF will take a hit. We have been in a bull run for 9 years(I argue less but won't talk about here) and its obvious we will hit a bear market eventually. Airlines are quite cyclical and a small recession will impact consumers spending. Much like oil prices, this will affect the revenue, profits and fcf for the company. They are also quite leveraged and higher interest rates could negatively effect their net income. A smaller risk is that the acquisition of Virgin America does not provide synergy causing investors to back out and lenders to be unwilling to give more money to ALK. The past 2 years have been rough. Alaska airline uses boeings while Virgin used Airbus which cause some operational issues. Management between the two took longer to become productive and internal politics became a bigger problem to solve than expected. This is clearly shown in the stocks lackluster performance over the past 2 years since the acquisition. While there maybe some rough road still ahead I believe management is becoming productive and the synergies will start to translate into earnings very soon.

**Dividend:** ALK currently pays a dividend of roughly 2&#37;. It is expected to hit 2.09&#37; next year. However I do not think it will grow significantly until after the synergies from the acquisition are realized.

**Future Trends**: Customer Service is more and more important as Americans have more money to spend. Considering the extremely low unemployment rates and the growth in spending power, It is reasonable to assume that Americans will choose to spend a little more to feel better. In this case it means paying a little extra for going from California to Seatle on ALK vs a budget ticket. IMO I think most customers will pay more for the satisfaction. As word of mouth continues to spread, more people will choose ALK over other West Coast airlines due to their strong brand and perks(free drinks!) The virgin acquisition strengthens their airport presence and with more hubs and more volume they should be able to lower prices while keeping their margins.

**Expectations:** Alaska Air Group stock is likely to continue its less than stellar growth this year. I personally have a price target of $70 by the end of 2018. Considering the summer months are the biggest for airlines, It has a possibility to get higher than $70 if they report significantly better than expected earnings for q2 q3. However we will have to wait until late this year, likely next year, for the earnings to stabilize and realize the synergies of Virgin acquisition. I have a price target of $100 by the end of 2019. And unless we have a bear market or considerably higher oil , I am confident in those targets. Although at they end of the day keep in mind they are just educated guesses and not accurate.

**Conclusion:** Alaska Air Group is a regional airline that has great brand strength as well as strong presence in their region. The stock has been lackluster due to some unexpected complications that arose when the acquisition of Virgin America took place. However I believe the complications have been solved and the power of the merger will start showing in the earnings soon. Due to the discount of intrinsic value to market price, as well as a decent 2&#37; dividend,ALK is a great 3-6 year hold with potential to double.

*Notes- Feel free to agree disagree , or even tear my analysis apart in the comments. Just keep it constructive and explain why. This is not a buy recommendation , rather its my opinion on the company.*

***Disclaimer- I am long ALK***",0.93,"[""I use to have Southwest and JetBlue. Made great gains from 2013-2015 but I'll never go back to airline stocks. Their stocks are effected by so many types of negative news whether it's about fuel prices, weather, trade wars, customer complaints on other airlines, overseas economies, a bad earnings report with a different stock negatively effecting yours...it's just too much. \n\nI believe a lot of airline stocks are currently undervalued and they keep building more cost effective planes that are always full of people...but the stocks still rarely trend up. Probably better off owning plane makers like Boeing instead. But even Boeing has taken a hit with all the tariff news this year. "", ""I want to play the short side for a second. ALK's biggest weakness is their scope. You mention they picked up VX to become a large West Coast provider and that there are synergies with the scope, but over 90% of their scope is still domestic even after the merger. This has its pros and cons but at the moment it's looking like a huge negative towards YoY growth. They have projected negative YoY revenue growth this upcoming quarter - along with every other domestic focused carrier. Airlines with more exposure abroad are doing stronger at the moment because international travel is up. Scope diversity is an ALK problem that the VX acquisition made worse. Also, airline customer service is a tough cookie to sell. Its been tried many times to differentiate on service in the airline industry but customers generally look at other factors like price, reliability, and connectivity over service. ALK has won a lot of awards but so has every other airline, the amount of awards given out to airlines is as ridiculous as the car industry. ALK's customer service differentiation is going to get harder to keep as they try to keep up with other airlines that are adding basic economy and buy ups which have proven to boost RASM and reduce CASM. They have already announced they are doing basic economy. As long as oil goes up, airlines will go down and vice versa"", 'Disclaimer I’m an amateur (at best) investor, but follow airlines quite closely. \n\nOne thing over the past year that definitely hurt Alaska’s profits was the ongoing pilot strike and shortage with Horizon Airlines. Horizon is a major feeder airline for Alaska and operates a ton of flights for them in smaller airports. Flight cancellations are an expensive proposition and this killed them for the first half of 2017. That was resolved but with a fairly substantial pay raise. The industry as a whole is going to have issues with the pilot shortage and I expect to see raises across all airlines. \n\nThe Virgin acquisition was a necessary move, but they also were forced to overpay as JetBlue also had a strong interest. Gaining airport slots, planes, and crews enabled them to grow significantly faster than they otherwise could have, but came with major challenges.  As you mentioned Alaska flies Boeing and Virgin Airbus, I think this will be a lingering issue for Alaska. Part of the business model that made Alaska so efficient and timely was having a single model of planes, B737. Sitting on a single model meant they didn’t have to deal with cross training employees or organizing the schedule around employees aircraft training, and sped up the time it took to ‘flip’ a plane, allowing for more flights in a day than legacy carriers could. IIRC Alaska and Southwest turn over planes on average close to 30 minutes as opposed to 1 hour by legacy airlines, which quickly adds up. Issues of crews timing out or cancelations due to sick or injured crew members are much easier to mitigate when all of your employees are interchangeable. This advantage was impaired by the addition of Virgin and their multiple Airbus models. The lease on those planes go until 2023 and they may need them all the way up to that point. \n\nAs far as long term views for Alaska, my biggest concern is competition with Southwest and expansions opportunities. Southwest expanding to Hawaii is going to cut down on the profitability on an already competitive market. Alaska has a considerable number of resources invested in Hawaii and has used that market to help fill many of its connecting flights in smaller markets. They also have to deal with Southwest expanding in California and challenging them for west coast supremacy. Southwest has been openly attacking them out west and targeting California customers in ways I’ve never see them do before. As you hit on, customer service is the hallmark for Alaska, and sets them apart from the legacy airlines. Anecdotally, people passionately love Alaska in a way I’ve not seen replicated for the legacy carriers. Unfortunately, Southwest also garners that same kind of enthusiasm.

* I'm 35, single and only make $31K a year while looking for higher paying work. Only debt I have is a $14,000 credit card. No student loans. I live with my Dad rent free at the moment (but that's another story)
* I'm in a Roth IRA through my company.
* My company requires at minimum a 3% contribution for them to match anything. I contribute 4%.
* My company matches 25% on the first 12% I contribute. If I contribute 12%, company matches 25% of the amount or 3%. I don't know what the 3% means in the handout they gave us. 
* If  I contribute 15%, the company matching is 3%(25% on the first 12% I contribute).
* I just got a raise which now brings me to $31k/year. I can't raise my contribute on that.
* I do have another retirement savings through my bank. Only putting $20 a pay in every paycheck. At the moment it's almost $2,000. I'm hoping to get this to $3,000 and maybe open a Vanguard account and take advantage of any growth opportunities.
* I only have $3,100 in my company Roth IRA. I'm trying to see if I can make the best portfolio with the 4% I'm contributing now. 
* For some reason when I began working at my employer 4 years ago. Their policy was that I had to wait an entire year before I could start saving for retirement. I was barred from contributing my own money and lost out on a year of potential gains. Even though the company wasn't making a contributions, there's no reason I couldn't make my own. That's why I had the second retirement account through my bank. It's just a savings account that has the Roth IRA label. It doesn't get any growth. It's not a deduction on my paycheck. I just go into my bank and move $20 contributions into the account. I was hoping to merge this amount with my company Roth IRA, but held off because I don't like Mass Mutual. I don't want fees.

AAPL07-31,941pmd,Bitcoin UBS report,1533233480.0,0,0,"On a standalone basis, using Bloomberg price data indicates that bitcoin's average annual return since the start of 2013 has been 216%. Comparatively, US stocks and IG bonds have risen on average 16% and 1.6% annually, respectively (the latter suffered from both taper tantrum and the more recent rise in US rates). Over this period, bitcoin has outperformed bonds by a big margin on a risk-adjusted basis, but only very modestly beat stocks. We use monthly returns and standard deviations to calculate the annualised Sharpe ratio for the three assets. We assume the risk-free rate is zero for ease of computation, and given that US T-bill yields were close to zero for the majority of that period. Bitcoin's standalone Sharpe ratio is 1.25, against 1.17 for the S&P 500 and 0.49 for US IG bonds. These findings are unsurprising given the unprecedented rise in the price of bitcoin.

We looked at how a typical portfolio would have behaved with and without bitcoin. As an illustrative exercise, we constructed two portfolios: 1) a US-centric 60% equity, 40% IG bonds; and 2) a more global version that includes 40% MSCI World, 20% MSCI EM, 15% US IG, 7.5% EM dollar bonds, 7.5% EM Local, 5% US HY and 5% gold. We then constructed two identical portfolios, with the exception of adding a 5% allocation of bitcoin, and reducing the weights of the other assets in proportion to their original weight. We used total returns and rebalanced our portfolio monthly.

Our results are interesting (Figures 13 & 14). First, the clear implication is that adding a 5% allocation of bitcoin to our sample portfolios would have increased returns considerably, by 11pp annually, roughly doubling the overall return for the US portfolio and tripling that for the global portfolio. Second, the standard deviation of the portfolios would have risen substantially too, doubling in both cases. However, this was not enough to deter an improvement in the overall Sharpe ratio for the portfolios after bitcoin was added, albeit small in the case of the US portfolio. This makes sense given that the standalone Sharpe ratio for bitcoin was higher than both portfolios before inclusion, so even if there were no diversification benefits whatsoever, the inclusion of bitcoin would have increased the ratio.

However, historically there have been meaningful diversification properties. Bitcoin's correlation with other asset classes has been, according to our analysis, close to negligible (Figure 15). This was also seen in the maximum drawdown calculation for the portfolios, which barely changed despite adding a highly volatile component. Therefore, adding bitcoin to a typical portfolio would have had a favourable impact on both absolute and risk-adjusted returns for the period considered.

But there are also natural limitations, which could restrict the connection between the past and the future. The current market capitalisation of bitcoin is roughly $130bn (down from as much as $325bn in December 2017). As a purely illustrative exercise, if bitcoin prices were to increase at a similar pace as they have done since 2013, this would imply a valuation of $7.8trn by 2021, without accounting for the increase in supply which would result in an even larger valuation. Not only does this dwarf the market capitalisation of the world's most valuable company, Apple Inc, by almost 10 times, but it is also roughly five times the total volume of US money in circulation.

\*There is no certainty on whether bitcoin's 2013-18 performance is likely to be repeated; the potential portfolio benefits implied by our calculations are purely illustrative",0.38,[]
AIG08-02,8wqq0n,Alaska Airlines Long Thesis,1530938941.0,28,28,"So I've seen a few post lately mentioning airlines around here and the other stock reddits and thought id share my brief pitch of going long on ALK from my reddit. Hopefully itll give yall something to consider. 

 Alaska Air Group Inc

**Alaska Air Lines**

NYSE:ALK

MktCp: 7.8B

**Core Business:** Alaska Air Group owns and operates Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, Horizon, McGee Air Services and some other smaller units. However I will focus on Alaska Airlines with consideration to the Virgin America acquisition since those are the biggest sources of revenue for the company. Most of their business comes from flights that transport customers to and from West coast destinations. However a significant percentage of their customers are connecting flights from West to Midwest/Atlantic

**Valuation:** Air Lines can be very tricky to put a price on. The business is very competitive and heavy on capital expenditures. Profit margins are consistently being brought down due to price matching other airlines. They naturally trade at low PE ratios. And historically have been value traps for investors. Therefore I proceed even more conservative than usual when constructing a DCF for this company. I assume that its free cash flow will grow 4&#37; on average for 5 years then reach terminal growth at 3 percent. This means some years it may lose fcf and others gain more than 4&#37; but I assume it will average out to 4&#37; yearly for the next five years. Using this I calculated a fair value of **$118 per share.** If my valuation is correct, ALK is very significantly undervalued.

**Competitive Advantage:** The commercial air line industry is all centered around offering the cheapest flights for customers and having small margins. Competitive advantages are usually either A) Niche Location or B) Brand Strength. I believe ALK has a strong case for both of these. The have a very significant presence in the West Coast having main flights going to Seattle to LA to Hawaii, even Costa Rica. The acquisition of Virgin America(although bad in the short term, more about it in risk section) will give them a greater share of the market in the region over the long term. Alaska Airlines has some of the best customer service and attention. They have had the highest customer satisfaction rate among airlines for 11 years straight(JD Power) and notable recent awards include best rewards program(Flyer talk 18), number 1 US Airline(Money 18),number 1 in Airline Quality Rating 2018, and ICCT Most fuel efficient Airline (2010-2017). I know some of these awards can be consider biased and some will say politics are involved but if you look at direct customer reviews of ALK and compare them to other regional airlines, its easy to tell that they have great customer satisfaction and its a priority to their business. To conclude I see ALK being a major player in a major market with an Amazon like focus on customer satisfactions.

**Risks:** Believe it or not, competition is not the biggest risk to Alaska Airlines. Oil prices and a recession are the biggest risks to Alaska Airlines as well as the airline industry. Oil prices make the biggest difference in profits for airlines companies. If oil continues to rise, airlines will have to raise ticket prices across the board. Higher tickets may impact the amount of customers willing to travel. If this happens and prices continue to rise, ALK's revenue,profits and FCF will take a hit. We have been in a bull run for 9 years(I argue less but won't talk about here) and its obvious we will hit a bear market eventually. Airlines are quite cyclical and a small recession will impact consumers spending. Much like oil prices, this will affect the revenue, profits and fcf for the company. They are also quite leveraged and higher interest rates could negatively effect their net income. A smaller risk is that the acquisition of Virgin America does not provide synergy causing investors to back out and lenders to be unwilling to give more money to ALK. The past 2 years have been rough. Alaska airline uses boeings while Virgin used Airbus which cause some operational issues. Management between the two took longer to become productive and internal politics became a bigger problem to solve than expected. This is clearly shown in the stocks lackluster performance over the past 2 years since the acquisition. While there maybe some rough road still ahead I believe management is becoming productive and the synergies will start to translate into earnings very soon.

**Dividend:** ALK currently pays a dividend of roughly 2&#37;. It is expected to hit 2.09&#37; next year. However I do not think it will grow significantly until after the synergies from the acquisition are realized.

**Future Trends**: Customer Service is more and more important as Americans have more money to spend. Considering the extremely low unemployment rates and the growth in spending power, It is reasonable to assume that Americans will choose to spend a little more to feel better. In this case it means paying a little extra for going from California to Seatle on ALK vs a budget ticket. IMO I think most customers will pay more for the satisfaction. As word of mouth continues to spread, more people will choose ALK over other West Coast airlines due to their strong brand and perks(free drinks!) The virgin acquisition strengthens their airport presence and with more hubs and more volume they should be able to lower prices while keeping their margins.

**Expectations:** Alaska Air Group stock is likely to continue its less than stellar growth this year. I personally have a price target of $70 by the end of 2018. Considering the summer months are the biggest for airlines, It has a possibility to get higher than $70 if they report significantly better than expected earnings for q2 q3. However we will have to wait until late this year, likely next year, for the earnings to stabilize and realize the synergies of Virgin acquisition. I have a price target of $100 by the end of 2019. And unless we have a bear market or considerably higher oil , I am confident in those targets. Although at they end of the day keep in mind they are just educated guesses and not accurate.

**Conclusion:** Alaska Air Group is a regional airline that has great brand strength as well as strong presence in their region. The stock has been lackluster due to some unexpected complications that arose when the acquisition of Virgin America took place. However I believe the complications have been solved and the power of the merger will start showing in the earnings soon. Due to the discount of intrinsic value to market price, as well as a decent 2&#37; dividend,ALK is a great 3-6 year hold with potential to double.

*Notes- Feel free to agree disagree , or even tear my analysis apart in the comments. Just keep it constructive and explain why. This is not a buy recommendation , rather its my opinion on the company.*

***Disclaimer- I am long ALK***",0.95,"[""I use to have Southwest and JetBlue. Made great gains from 2013-2015 but I'll never go back to airline stocks. Their stocks are effected by so many types of negative news whether it's about fuel prices, weather, trade wars, customer complaints on other airlines, overseas economies, a bad earnings report with a different stock negatively effecting yours...it's just too much. \n\nI believe a lot of airline stocks are currently undervalued and they keep building more cost effective planes that are always full of people...but the stocks still rarely trend up. Probably better off owning plane makers like Boeing instead. But even Boeing has taken a hit with all the tariff news this year. "", ""I want to play the short side for a second. ALK's biggest weakness is their scope. You mention they picked up VX to become a large West Coast provider and that there are synergies with the scope, but over 90% of their scope is still domestic even after the merger. This has its pros and cons but at the moment it's looking like a huge negative towards YoY growth. They have projected negative YoY revenue growth this upcoming quarter - along with every other domestic focused carrier. Airlines with more exposure abroad are doing stronger at the moment because international travel is up. Scope diversity is an ALK problem that the VX acquisition made worse. Also, airline customer service is a tough cookie to sell. Its been tried many times to differentiate on service in the airline industry but customers generally look at other factors like price, reliability, and connectivity over service. ALK has won a lot of awards but so has every other airline, the amount of awards given out to airlines is as ridiculous as the car industry. ALK's customer service differentiation is going to get harder to keep as they try to keep up with other airlines that are adding basic economy and buy ups which have proven to boost RASM and reduce CASM. They have already announced they are doing basic economy. As long as oil goes up, airlines will go down and vice versa"", 'Disclaimer I’m an amateur (at best) investor, but follow airlines quite closely. \n\nOne thing over the past year that definitely hurt Alaska’s profits was the ongoing pilot strike and shortage with Horizon Airlines. Horizon is a major feeder airline for Alaska and operates a ton of flights for them in smaller airports. Flight cancellations are an expensive proposition and this killed them for the first half of 2017. That was resolved but with a fairly substantial pay raise. The industry as a whole is going to have issues with the pilot shortage and I expect to see raises across all airlines. \n\nThe Virgin acquisition was a necessary move, but they also were forced to overpay as JetBlue also had a strong interest. Gaining airport slots, planes, and crews enabled them to grow significantly faster than they otherwise could have, but came with major challenges.  As you mentioned Alaska flies Boeing and Virgin Airbus, I think this will be a lingering issue for Alaska. Part of the business model that made Alaska so efficient and timely was having a single model of planes, B737. Sitting on a single model meant they didn’t have to deal with cross training employees or organizing the schedule around employees aircraft training, and sped up the time it took to ‘flip’ a plane, allowing for more flights in a day than legacy carriers could. IIRC Alaska and Southwest turn over planes on average close to 30 minutes as opposed to 1 hour by legacy airlines, which quickly adds up. Issues of crews timing out or cancelations due to sick or injured crew members are much easier to mitigate when all of your employees are interchangeable. This advantage was impaired by the addition of Virgin and their multiple Airbus models. The lease on those planes go until 2023 and they may need them all the way up to that point. \n\nAs far as long term views for Alaska, my biggest concern is competition with Southwest and expansions opportunities. Southwest expanding to Hawaii is going to cut down on the profitability on an already competitive market. Alaska has a considerable number of resources invested in Hawaii and has used that market to help fill many of its connecting flights in smaller markets. They also have to deal with Southwest expanding in California and challenging them for west coast supremacy. Southwest has been openly attacking them out west and targeting California customers in ways I’ve never see them do before. As you hit on, customer service is the hallmark for Alaska, and sets them apart from the legacy airlines. Anecdotally, people passionately love Alaska in a way I’ve not seen replicated for the legacy carriers. Unfortunately, Southwest also garners that same kind of enthusiasm. Their models are so similar that the advantage Alaska has when going head to head with a legacy carrier are mitigated versus Southwest. Lastly, I am unsure what expansion opportunities are available to Alaska. Slot restrictions at airports in the most desirable locations and the slow rate of airplane acquisition (slowed further by purchasing only one model) are significant hurdles to overcome. Going after the Midwest makes the most sense given their strength in the PNW, but taking on Delta in their home turf is a major undertaking. Expanding to the east coast or the south would involve setting up a hub there, which is an expensive proposition, in addition to taking on the legacy carriers established there. The southwest market means more time taking on Southwest. The best option to expand would mean another acquisition, The only two logical acquisitions would be Hawaiian airlines or JetBlue. Hawaiian would almost certainly be blocked, has even more route redundancy, and the same airplane issue. JetBlue, however, would be a perfect acquisition in terms of route network and business model. It does present the same issue of aircraft type that the Virgin acquisition did, however, at that point you could make an argument for having a primarily B737 fleet with a number of the A321 for specific routes. Unfortunately they are in absolutely no position financially to make that move. I hope that they are able to succeed, and agree in principal that they’re undervalued, with the merger and horizon strike tamping down profits last year, but I am not sure they can soar quite to the same heights (please excuse the metaphor, I couldn’t help myself)  you’re projecting. ', ""Not sure I agree that competition isn't a primary concern. Delta has really encroached into Seattle with new west coast and trans pacific routes. Even if Alaska still has a superior product, there's no way their yields haven't decreased because of this. Delta also has more leverage to gain lucrative corporate contracts. \n\nHowever, I do actually own the stock because imo the industry is severely under valued. Alaska, SW, and Delta are the best 3 managed airlines. Over the long term I think any of these 3 should have nice returns. "", 'In terms of growth, I think Alaska will have trouble competing directly with SW.  their target customers are the same and SW is the name brand.  Competition is good though, and if cheaper prices and better service are possible it will be good for all of us, shareholders included.\n\nTo challenge your assertion about well managed though: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sfgate.com/chris-mcginnis/amp/Alaska-Airlines-SFO-diversions-13004295.php\n\nNovelty is great, but even the threat of a bus trip in Bay Area traffic is enough for me to never fly Alaska again to SFO.  How a major policy change like this made it through upper management and even through PR leads me to wonder if this is just evidence that the company suffers from poor decision making at every level?', 'Can you do this sort of thing again but with another company? Fucking brilliant shit.', 'BTW The more detailed dcf price was around 110. I slightly mismeasured cashflow ', '>Due to the discount of intrinsic value to market price, as well as a decent 2% dividend\n\nWow a DCF that gives a $70 target **and a 2% dividend?!**']"

GPN08-02,91211h,WSJ: Tesla Asks Suppliers for Cash Back to Help Turn a Profit,1532301623.0,271,571,"Tesla Inc. (TSLA) has asked some suppliers to refund a portion of what the electric-car company has spent previously, an appeal that reflects the auto maker’s urgency to sustain operations during a critical production period.

The Silicon Valley electric car company said it is asking its suppliers for cash back to help it become profitable, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that was sent to a supplier last week. Tesla requested the supplier return what it calls a meaningful amount of money of its payments since 2016, according to the memo.

The auto maker’s memo, sent by a global supply manager, described the request as essential to Tesla’s continued operation and characterized it as an investment in the car company to continue the long-term growth between both players.

While Tesla said in the memo that all suppliers were being asked to help it become profitable, it is unclear how many were asked for a discount on contracted spending amounts retroactively. Some suppliers contacted about the request said they were unaware of such a demand.

Tesla declined to comment on the specific memo. But it confirmed it is seeking price reductions from suppliers for projects, some of which date back to 2016, and some of which final acceptance many not yet have occurred. The company called such requests a standard part of procurement negotiations to improve its competitive advantage, especially as it ramps up Model 3 production.

The surprising requests raise further questions about Tesla’s cash position, which has dwindled after it struggled to boost production of its first car designed for mainstream buyers, the Model 3. After months of delays, Tesla last quarter reached its longstanding goal of making 5,000 Model 3s in a single week, which, if sustained, will help it generate cash.

Auto makers and suppliers have complicated relationships, each fighting for the best deal under immense pricing pressure. Supply chain consultants say sometimes auto makers will demand a reduction in price for a current contract going forward or use leverage of awarding a new deal to get upfront savings on a contract. But they say it is unusual for an auto maker to ask for a refund for past work.",0.9,"['[removed]', ""Oh, hello there. It's Elon. Listen, thanks for all the parts we bought from you.

I read somewhere it costs between $30-50 per month to charge an electric car for the average user.  According to a google search I just did that seems off, the average residential electric bill is a little over $100, so potentially selling 50% more electricity to select users could catch investors off guard and rally earnings as electric car adoption happens.

(Reuters) - Shares of CVS Health Corp       and health insurer Aetna Inc         rose more than 2 percent on Thursday after CNBC reported that the  U.S. Justice Department will not challenge their planned merger.     

CNBC said  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/cvs-aetna-shares-rise-on-report-doj-wont-challenge-their-merger-deal.html  Bloomberg reported the news, citing trade publication Reorg Research.

EQIX08-08,95yz6j,Cloud Computing ETF,1533838824.0,16,5,"Think Social Networks, Internet of Things, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, YouTube and Smartphone, and you realize that everyone of these enormous trends rely heavily on the ""cloud"".

Well there's a way to invest in the ""cloud"" and it probably a smart move. The $SKYY - First Trust Cloud Computing ETF has an incredible track record. This is probably the only pure play etf on cloud computing, and it has a seven year track record unlike any other.

The providers note that this fund offer exposures to the cloud computing space via a mix of pure-play, non pure play and Technology conglomerate cloud computing entities.

Presently the fund has AUM of $1.8 billion, and it's Expense Ratio is at 0.60%, and they've definitely earned their fees. Because since it inception, investors have had nothing short of a tremendous experience in this ETF. 

Here's a look at its performance to the end of July:

Year to date: 20.1%
1 Year:  34.71%
3 Years:  22.36% 
5 Years: 18.70%

Of course when you think of cloud computing, the first thing that comes to mind is Amazon Web Services (aws), and although the SKYY has 4.85% exposure to Amazon, they had managed to find other names that are active in the cloud computing space. The ETF currently has about 30 holdings, here are the top 10:

NETAPP INC 5.09%
AMAZON INC 4.85%
ALPHABET CL A 4.84%
EQUINIX INC 4.78%
SALESFORCE INC 4.73%
VMWARE INC 4.72%
OPEN TEXT CORP  4.70%
ORACLE CORP 4.40%
SAP SE 4.34%
F5 NETWORKS INC 4.33%

The cloud computing space had seen some serious growth over the last 5 years, currently estimated to be around  $180 billion worldwide, and expected to triple by 2021 to a market worth $554 billion worldwide.  

Definitely a space worth getting to know.

Alkermes has two big FDA deadlines and events in the upcoming months which will be the focus of this write up.  The first is ALKS 5461 for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder with the FDA advisory committee discussing the NDA application for the drug candidate on November 1st as well as a PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  The second is ALKS 4230 for treatment of Solid Tumors, where they are reporting Phase I initial data in the second half of 2018.  I will be setting 2 dates for this write up to remind investors of the Advisory Meeting/data presentation sometime in the next 2 months, as well as the PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  With multiple catalysts in the pipeline in the next 3 months, Alkermes is an exciting company to watch.


**Specific Drugs:**

**ALKS 5461**

AKLS 5461, buprenorphine/samidorphan, is a k-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist which functions as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).  The buprenorphine is a partial agonist of µ-opioid receptors (MOR), antagonist of the KOR, as well as a slight antagonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and a weak agonist of the nociception receptor (NOP).  Samidorphan on the other hand is a preferential antagonist of the MOR, allowing for the combination of the two to function as a stopper to KORs with negligible activation of MORs.  
Essentially this means that by activating the KOR, opioid peptides which are endogenous ligands of the KOR and function by inversing morphine-like, euphoric endorphins, create a sense of dysphoria and psychotomimetic effects, and are to produce changes in neuroplasticity evoked by chronic stress that has led to the development of depression and CNS disorders and drug addiction.  It is suggested in research that inhibiting the KOR abolishes antidepressant-like effects of buprenorphine, but the drug exhibits both antagonistic and agonist properties.  This has led to the concern that in theory, ALKS-5461 could be limited in the effectiveness of treatment of depression.  

Granted a Fast Track Designation in 2013, the drug has proceeded up to Phase III where thee different trials were initiated for the treatment of depression.  The first two trials failed in 2016, FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, however based on the third trial, FORWARD-5, the company submitted an NDA in 2017 for ALKS-5461.  Things started to look grim for the company moving forward, as the FDA served Alkermes a refuse-to-file letter saying that more data from well-controlled clinical trials must be presented before an application would be recognized.  However, just two weeks after serving the notice, the FDA rescinded their letter and accepted the NDA after productive interactions with Alkermes where the company clarified certain aspects of the NDA.  No further data was needed to rescind the letter and PDUFA date is scheduled by January 31, 2019.

The first two trials failed after the company reported higher placebo responses as the chief obstacle in their studies.  Not something a company would like to hear in relation to an antidepressant medication.  Causing the stock to plummet 44% in 2016, from nearly $80 to under $40, the company has been slowly recovering since.  ALKS-5461’s fate lies in the hands of FORWARD-5, without a clear success and perfect data, an FDA approval seems unlikely for this drug. 

FORWARD-5 focused on two doses of 1mg/1mg and 2mg/2mg of ALKS-5461 for adjunct treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).  Concurrently to taking ALKS-5461, the patients also remained on background antidepressant therapy.  With 407 patients enrolled, 63 received 1mg/1mg, 63 received 2mg/2mg, and 280 received the placebo.  The study was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 was 5 weeks, Stage 2 was 6 weeks. In Stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. For Stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. Depression scores were assessed using the 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) and MADRS-10, an assessment tool for depression.

In the study, ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by 6-item MADRS scores (p=0.018). ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 10-item MADRS scores compared to placebo (p=0.026). The 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS-5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo.  2mg/2mg treatment did show a significant change, warranting its efficacy while also having no incidences of withdrawal or pattern of adverse effects suggesting abuse potential.  The clinical benefit of the compound maintained through 11-week study and the compound is relatively safe and tolerable.  Where FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 failed to meet their endpoints, FORWARD-5 succeed in meeting primary endpoint for the 2mg/2mg dose, showing great efficacy when compared to a placebo.   
November 1st, 2018, the FDA advisory committee is meeting to discuss ALKS-5471 in relation to the compound’s efficacy, safety and risk-benefit profile of the NDA for buprenorphine and samidorphan sublingual tablets for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.  In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee roughly 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  

**ALKS-4230**

Currently in Phase I of development, Alkermes does a change of pace with this immuno-oncology drug for the treatment of solid tumors, making a shift away from their regular market in the CNS disease space.  This drug candidate is an engineered fusion protein comprised of permuted interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 Receptor (IL-2R) α made specifically to only activate the intermediate-affinity IL-2R.  The intermediate-affinity IL-2R is expressed mainly on effector lymphocytes, which are essential in generating an antitumor immune response.  IL-2 is a cell signaling molecule which plays a role in controlling the life cycle of specialized T-cells.  ALKS-4230 selectively binds to intermediate-affinity IL-2R to both activate and increase in number the immune cells that work to battle cancer.  Their selectivity, however, means they don’t bind to the “high-affinity IL-2 receptor,” so as not to trigger greater activity or proliferation in immune cells that could dampen an anti-tumor response Research has suggested that selective activation of the intermediate-affinity IL-2R by ALKS-4230 has the potential to provide enhanced tumor killing as well as improved tolerability. 
ALKS-4230 is currently in Phase I in patients with advanced solid tumors. Key study objectives are to determine a recommended phase 2 dose and characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and evidence of antitumor activity. A dose-escalation phase in patients with refractory solid tumors (Part A) will be followed by expansion cohorts in defined populations (Part B). ALKS 4230 is administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for five days each cycle. The dose will be escalated until reaching maximum tolerated dose or an Optimal Biologic Dose. The first two dose cohorts will use a 3+3 design. Subsequent cohorts in Part A will enroll a minimum of 6 subjects. In Part B up to 21 patients will be enrolled into each of four tumor-specific cohorts. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for PK, immunogenicity and PD assessments. The primary PD endpoint is change-from-baseline in CD8+ T, NK and T reg cell counts. Other PD measures include serum concentrations of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and immunohistochemical assessment of markers of immune activation in tumor tissue from selected patients. 

Animal trials conducted previously were positive and showed the anti-tumor activity of ALKS-4230, both alone and with the checkpoint inhibitors. Rodents treated with ALKS-4230 were seen to have lesser tumor growth and better survival, supporting clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 as a potential immunotherapy in the oncology space. ALKS-4230 will be administered in combination with PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells, complimenting the mechanisms of action from ALKS-4230.  Alkermes has accelerated clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab based on data from the ongoing monotherapy dose-escalation stage of the phase 1 study, where ALKS 4230 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on circulating natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells, and minimal and non-dose dependent effects on immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.  

Initial data from Phase I is due in the second half of 2018, estimated to come out early November.


**Competition and Market:**

ALKS-4230 is a tough market, cancer is a hot sector but it continually sees failure.  While the FDA holds the stance that they want to try to push new oncology and immuno-oncology drugs through the approval process and get them to market to potentially save or extend lives, their decisions tend to skew otherwise.  Being so early on in development, it’s not necessary to dive into the market in depth as there is a large, unmet need in the oncology sector with the main focus being in immuno-oncology.

MDD has a multifaceted and varied etiology, and remains poorly understood. The MDD market is overly crowded and overly competitive, surpassing 30 FDA approved products available for the treatment of patients, the majority of which are now available as inexpensive generics. The MDD market is currently in an active transition where patents are expiring on top-selling products such as Eli Lilly's Cymbalta and Otsuka/BMS' Abilify, paving way for launches of Lundbeck/Takeda's Trintellix and Otsuka/Lundbeck's Rexulti.  These will create a significant growth in the market as cheaper generics will become available.  Growth in the MDD market is also expected to be driven by the potential introduction of numerous promising late-stage pipeline products into the market during the next few years which are directed at treatment-resistant patients.  These products include Alkermes' ALKS-5461, Allergan/Gedeon Richter/Mitsubishi Tanabe's Vraylar, Axsome Therapeutics' AXS-05, Janssen's esketamine, and Allergan's rapastinel.

MDD is the most common mental disorder in the U.S., affecting approximately 16 million American adults, of which about one-third remain untreated. The number of treated patients is projected to rise on account of expiring patents, the increase in available generic products, and rising awareness regarding depression and mental health issues.  This competitive market was priced at a massive $3.2 billion in 2015 and is expected to consistently grow at a CAGR of 6.1% until 2025 to reach $5.8 billion.  With the current social standings of mental health, students being required to take mandatory mental health courses now in many places, and social workers and therapists being more commonplace in schools and work places, we should see a larger surge in my opinion.  Growing female prevalence, increase in prescription spending, and escalating awareness of mental health will propel the growth of this market for many years to come.


**Financials:**

Alkermes has a great financial standing in the biotech industry.  Leveraging both their approved products and impressive collaborations, the company was able to boast a revenue growth of 39% ($304.6 million) through product sales and payments.  Many opportunities lined up for the company and set them up for success this second quarter. 

*Vivitrol sales increased 15% to $76.2 million

*Aristada sales increased 48% to $33.6 million

*Royalties from Johnson & Johnson partnership increased 4% to $85.2 million

*Royalties from Acorda Therapeutics decreased 22% to $19.7 million

*License revenue from Biogen generated $48.3 million in revenue


Despite increased operation costs related to commercializing their products and further research and development, the company posted a Non-GAAP net income of $45.6 million and a Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29. With a total cash balance of $561 million and total debt of $280 million, the company stands on strong ground.  This second half of 2018 has several catalysts, combined with increasing revenues from collaborations and drug approvals, Alkermes is likely to see success, only to be complimented by hopefully positive data from their upcoming Phase I and PDUFA dates. The company is expecting to hit $1 billion in revenues for 2018 as a year, which would be a massive milestone for the pharmaceutical company.


**Review:**

Historically, the FDA has been flexible with depression medications, but failures will weigh Alkermes down.  Depression studies have had a flurry of failures over recent history, and failure here can dissuade further research in the pharmaceutical space until more is known on the biology side.  With over 30 currently approved products on the market for MDD, it is overly saturated and failure can spell the end for the drug.  Following their failures in FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, investors are weary of another failure, especially after the initial NDA was rejected.  Good news is, there is an advisory committee meeting in November to discuss ALKS-5461. In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee only about 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  Chances are from that perspective that the FDA will grant approval.  The compound also shows no suggestion of tolerance of therapeutic effects, the side effect profile was generally comparable to standard medications with no significant late appearing side effects, and when medication was halted there was no sign of opioid withdrawal.  With the competitive, growing market and patents expiring, a new and novel MDD treatment would be a value add.

In the case of the early stage ALKS-4230, oncology drug candidates historically have a 57% possibility of success moving from Phase I to Phase II compared to an industry average of 63.2% possibility of success.  This does shine in comparison to the oncology end success rate of a low 3.4%.  If I were to put my money where my mouth is, I am going with the data and not the suggestive words of the FDA to say that oncology might sound like a great industry with the backing of the FDA, but their actions prove otherwise.  Oncology drugs are more likely to be denied by the FDA and fail their clinical trials at much higher rates than other industries such as vaccines which show an end rate of success over 30%.  I would guess this drug might make it to Phase III with time, but statistically it is unlikely to see approval.  While Phase III or even Phase II are years away from completion, the data in Phase I will likely reveal a lot about the drug to make future estimations off of.  I see Phase I being positive.

Currently the stock is trading around $43 and showing a high level of support and consolidation in this zone.  With a high of over $70 not 7 months ago, the company is likely to recover and soar.  This stock does not take bad news well however, seeing several 10% or more drops over the past year, but never going under $40 for long.  I think between $42-46 are great entries for this stock.  Long term their finances are growing, increasing revenues from royalties and sales of their own approved products, on track to hit $1 billion in revenues this year, and a solid pipeline that shows great promise.  I would bank on good data from ALKS-4230 as well as a positive hearing from the advisory committee.  With the PDUFA date in January, we will see a heavy run up into the end of the year.  I would take advantage of this price entry for either a long-term hold or a swing trade.  I would predict levels of up to $55 in the coming 3 months.

Full disclosure I'm long this stock.  There's been some discussion over housing and home inventories and home builder stock have gotten absolutely nailed over the last few months over expectations that rising rates would sap demand.  There was finally some good news today with Pulte reporting better than expected earnings and stating that market conditions don't look like they're conductive to overbuilding.  New orders for Pulte only rose around 1% YoY but they also have around 2 full quarters worth of backlog and have seen improving margins with recent home price increases.  It seems supportive of the idea that for the most part home sales are more likely to flatten than collapse.  

Anecdotally though I have noticed some price cuts more recently in my area on existing homes.  I think part of that is people just asking too much given the financing environment and also sellers looking to close on a deal before winter hits in full force and buyers dry up.

One thing I am watching is sales data on higher end home builders.  That seems to be the segment under the greatest pressure right now with interest rates rising and price pressures in expensive urban environments.  West cost seems to be worse off than areas like Texas and Atlanta.  Again anecdotally higher end builders like NVR are still selling out communities in the D.C Metro area so the bite doesn't seem too bad on the east coast yet.

Discussion and observations appreciated.",0.66,"[""I'm with you. Home builders have been getting hit disproportionately as of late due to rising material prices and slowing demand from rising rates. But when you drill into the housing data there seems to be a disconnect between what the data shows and the headlines. It seems everyone wants to be the ones to cry wolf on housing as if it's 2006 again, but it clearly isn't. The housing market of today never came close to returning to the frothy levels prior to the GFC, nor has the pace of starts.\n\nI cover $IBP from an institutional debt perspective and find some solace in the fact their average home price is on the lower end, which should help them ride the storm on the demand side a bit better. On the cost side they have been successful in passing through price increases and I expect this trend to continue. \n\nBut at the end of the day there is still a lack of supply in many key markets. Higher mortgage costs may be putting a crimp on home prices, but I see this trend largely effecting secondary sales of homes, not undermining the lack of supply that drives home builder volumes. \n\nI cautiously agree with your view home builders are a good value right now. I say cautiously because it is late cycle and this sector is about as cyclical as it gets. IBP has yet to report Q3 earnings, but Plute's results bode well.""]"

Say I have a company, Penguins Inc..

1 million shares outstanding.

$10 price per share.. so the market thinks the total company is worth $10 million

The corporation has a pile of $1 million cash they want to get rid of before inflation eats it. So they do buybacks.

100,000 shares get bought and annihilated. That $1 million cash is now gone.

The company's market cap ought to be $9 million now.. because it's the same company as when it was valued at $10 million, but now it's missing a $1 million pile of money.

There are now only 900,000 shares outstanding. $9 million divided by 900,000 is $10.. so the price per share should remain the same.

What am I missing?",0.74,"['ITT: people who have never read an undergrad corporate finance textbook.', 'Your question shows a lack of understanding of how markets work (sorry for being blunt).\n\nThe market price of stocks may or may not have anything to do with the value of the stock or any financing or capital structure. That is the whole principle of value investing.\n\nAfter the buyback the market could value the shares at $0.10 cents a share with a market cap of $90,000 if they want. Or they could go crazy and think the shares are worth $100.\n\nOver the short run the market cap and price per share change by the minute sometimes for reasons that are completely irrational that have nothing to do with the fundamentals.\n\nThe share buy back will move from an asset (cash) to equity (treasury stock) on the balance sheet. It does not create or destroy shareholder value unless the price changes in the future. If the price is more than $10 in the future, then shareholders benefit. If its less than $10, they lose out and the share buybacks were a bad deal. The treasury stock value will fluctuate as the share price changes. This is exactly the same dilemma of a common shareholder buying the stock on the open market at a price of $10 and experiencing changes in the future.\n\nThat is why companies should only buy back shares when they feel that they are undervalued and there are no capital investments that yield a higher rate internal rate of return.\n\nShare buybacks become evil when management ignores the value proposition of buying shares and instead use them as a tool to artificially meet EPS or share price targets so that their stock options pay out. \n\nIt can also be questionable when a company is issuing debt to perform share buyback as it could help the stock in the short term but over the long run it could leave the company over-indebted with and stuck with shares that it overpaid for. Or it could be a brilliant management move, issuing low interest debt to buy stock that appreciates over the long term. \n\nOver the long run studies have shown that buybacks destroy shareholder value because management tends to overpay for shares due to conflicts of interests. That does not mean all buy backs are bad.', 'ITT people think $1 removed as a cash asset does not translate in $1 removed from market cap. Price per share should not be moving on a buyback (unless company is over or undervalued). Only the percent you own from the company. Say you owned 100,000 shares pre buyback (10%). After buyback you own 11.11% of the company (100,000 shares each worth $10 on $9million). Buybacks does not add value to market cap. Neither does dividends (well, dividends decreases market cap, as does buybacks, which you have figured out).', ""Let's assume this company has a net income of $1 million and is expected to continue generating that much indefinitely.\n\nBefore the buyback, the cash and net income is split into 1 million shares. This means is that each share represents $1 of net income every year they hold this company, and $0.10 cash.\n\nAfter the buyback, there is no more cash, but the net income will be split into 900,000 shares. This means each share represents $1.11 of net income every year and $0 in cash.\n\nWithout talking about the theory of valuation, I think you can see that a pre-buyback share is distinctly different than a post-buyback share. As a result, the two of them sometimes do have a different value. It's also worth noting that companies will usually only do buybacks if they think that this transaction will add value for their shareholders."", 'Sometimes companies have excess cash that is undervalued by the market.  \nA typical valuation splits the excess cash valued dollar for dollar and adds it back to the multiple of earnings that would make sense without the excess cash.

Some management teams seem heavily biased toward such actions.  So the cash is valued less than dollar for dollar because it seems likely to be wasted.  So if management instead selects a buyback, that choice raises the price.  \n  \nIn stranger cases, the market seems unwilling to accept the high overall P/E that is created by adding cash to the price from sensible P/E.

The Colorado company [Charlotte's Web](https://www.cwhemp.com/) went [IPO last month](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/charlottes-web-holdings-inc-completes-initial-public-offering-692082021.html) @ $7 CAD under the Canadian ticker $CWEB, followed by the US OTC ticker $CWBHF.

Now I know what you're thinking: shut the fuck up about Cannabis stocks it's a fucking bubble look at Tilray. And yea, I get it. But I'm going to put my info down here anyways and you can decide for yourself or down-vote me.

1. **This company doesn't sell weed**. Their products contain minimal THC and is legally sold in the US as a ""natural"" CBD product derived from hemp.

2. The CBD market [will probably](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarabrittanysomerset/2018/09/12/will-cbd-entirely-eclipse-the-cannabis-market/#27af35c97beb) be [much larger](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/new-study-cbd-market-22-billion-2022-722852/) than the THC market. As well, with recreational cannabis slowly becoming legal, it's providing a much easier avenue for people to try CBD products. In the last two years, the US market for hemp-derived CBD supplements has experienced robust growth and is expected to grow at a 55% CAGR over 2016-2021, according to the Brightfield Group ([from the cannacord report](http://cdn.ceo.ca.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1dq4vhg-CWEB%2B-%2BInitiation.pdf)).

> One of the slides included the proposed size of the fund: $30 billion. The figure would make the Vision Fund, as Son had named it, about four times the size of the largest venture capital fund ever created and bigger than any private equity fund in history.

> Son stared at the number for a moment. Then he deleted the three and replaced it with a one and another zero. **“Life’s too short to think small,”** he told a stunned Misra.

> When Son came to the $100 billion slide in his presentation a few hours later, the prospective investors—executives from a state-owned fund in the Middle East—laughed. Son didn’t, continuing his presentation as if nothing had happened. “He didn’t miss a beat,” recalls Misra, now the fund’s CEO.

> As an investor, Son has been prescient. He was one of the earliest backers of Yahoo! and then teamed up with the dot-com-era darling to launch Yahoo! Japan, a property that wound up being much more valuable than its parent. In 2000 he put about $20 million into Alibaba Group Holding Inc. That stake is now worth roughly $120 billion.

> In less than a year since the fund first began making investments, it has already committed $65 billion to acquire big stakes in Uber, WeWork, Slack, and GM Cruise. Son tells Bloomberg Businessweek that he plans to raise a new $100 billion fund every two or three years and will spend around $50 billion a year. For perspective, in 2016, the entire U.S. venture capital industry invested $75.3 billion, according to the National Venture Capital Association.

> Son’s audaciously large bets have astonished and confused Silicon Valley, where even the most respected venture capitalists have found themselves outmaneuvered by a relative newcomer.

> The standard VC playbook involves making small, speculative investments in early-stage startups and adding funds in follow-on rounds as those startups grow. SoftBank’s strategy has been to put enormous sums—its smallest deals are $100 million or so, its biggest are in the billions—into the most successful tech startups in a given category.

> SoftBank, according to a partner at a major Silicon Valley firm, is “a big stack bully,” a poker term referring to a player with a pile of chips so huge that competitors are afraid to get in the game.

> SoftBank’s success in pushing fast-growing startups into a dominant position gives Son an advantage when negotiating for a stake in a company. He hasn’t been shy in pressing that advantage. In 2015, online lending startup Social Finance Inc. was looking to raise a few hundred million dollars, but Son wanted to invest more. According to SoFi co-founder Mike Cagney, **Son told him that he was going to invest $1 billion in online lending—whether that capital went to SoFi or its competitors was up to Cagney. The entrepreneur opted to take the deal.**

> Hardball tactics aside, others have raised questions about whether SoftBank’s megadeals will be profitable for Son or his backers in the long run. The Vision Fund’s war chest includes about $40 billion in debt, an unusually risky structure for a venture capital firm.

> To show a 20 percent internal rate of return on its own capital—which would be a solid return for a VC—SoftBank would need to produce lots of startups with a $10 billion market capitalization and at least two with market caps of over $100 billion, according to research published by EquityZen Inc., a platform for trading stock in privately held companies.

That\'s a good way to ensure that a bigger competitor would overtake their business or that they\'ll just run into problems due to not having enough funding. I\'d give them what they ask for and prepare to give them even more if they need it.\n\nAlso VC investments value the company, so it\'s an easy way to get a higher valuation quicker, it\'s like pump and dump at a bigger scale.\n\n\nThough I also understand why I wouldn\'t want to take on super large investment as a business.

I wouldn\'t want to overextend myself thinking ""Oh now I have a ton of room!"" I might also get blinded by the money not knowing what to do next.

T10-24,9rtzzy,The U.S. Secretly Halted JPMorgan’s Growth for Years [Bloomberg],1540644520.0,19,1,"For almost six years, Washington secretly shackled JPMorgan Chase & Co., the nation’s biggest bank.

Now the chains are off, thanks to bank-friendly regulators in the Trump administration.

In actions never before made public, Obama administration regulators prevented the bank from opening branches in new states as punishment for violating banking rules, according to people familiar with the matter. JPMorgan’s ambitious plan to expand nationally, announced earlier this year, was made possible by the Trump administration’s rollback of those restraints, which date from 2012, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing regulators’ impact on the bank’s plans.

JPMorgan has racked up more than $30 billion in penalties, legal costs and related obligations since the 2008 financial crisis, some of which stemmed from its acquisitions of Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc. Missteps include excessive risk taken by the London Whale trader and failing to flag transactions related to Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Privately, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency stopped JPMorgan from expanding into additional states while resolving compliance breakdowns as part of an unwritten regulatory policy, the people said.

Expansion Ban
While banks often have private conversations with regulators and even gauge their reactions to potential plans, the people with knowledge of the matter described the ban as one of the more extreme ways they exerted their control behind the scenes.

Regulators went to even harsher lengths earlier this year to punish Wells Fargo & Co., placing a cap on its assets after a pattern of lapses and abuses. Janet Yellen, who served as Federal Reserve chair under President Barack Obama, announced the unprecedented punishment on her final workday in office.

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, operated 5,130 branches in 23 states at the end of last year. With fresh assurances from regulators under President Donald Trump, the people said, it’s planning to open 400 branches in as many as 20 new markets in the next five years, including plans to build in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. This is the first time the bank is opening branches in a new state in more than a decade. The moves could translate into an additional $1.5 billion of revenue a year by 2022, according to Morgan Stanley.

‘Extremely Excited’
“We are extremely excited to be expanding again, as smart regulatory policy and a competitive corporate tax system help us to deliver on our commitment to invest in our customers and communities,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said Oct. 12.

JPMorgan has resolved many of its compliance issues, but the OCC still has open enforcement actions against the bank, according to agency data.

Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the bank wouldn’t comment on supervisory issues.

“Opening new branches is a sustainable and long-term investment in the communities we serve,” Gray said. “Entering new markets will bring the full force of JPMorgan Chase’s business and philanthropic capabilities, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and allow us to serve more customers and local businesses by lending and investing in their community.”

OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard declined to comment.

New Branches
In loosening their grip on JPMorgan, authorities removed a critical barrier to the lender’s growth. A 1994 law prohibits mergers between banks if the transaction would give any of them control of more than 10 percent of U.S. deposits. With $1.3 trillion, JPMorgan already controls more than 10 percent -- second only to Bank of America Corp. -- which means adding branches in new markets is one of its only avenues for expansion.


Joseph OttingPhotographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg
The reversal comes amid anti-regulatory fervor under Trump. It’s also consistent with the declared willingness of the new OCC head, Joseph Otting, to give financial institutions more flexibility when resolving concerns raised by OCC staff. Otting worked closely with future Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at OneWest Bank, now part of CIT Group Inc., when the lender came under fire for its mortgage-servicing business.

The OCC has softened its approach to overseeing banks from the aggressive tone under Thomas Curry, who led the agency from 2012 to 2017. Curry instituted tough standards in an effort to change the perception that regulators were too close to the institutions they were meant to police.

Relaxed Stance
Banks are responding to friendlier regulators under Trump by pushing into new markets and reassessing deals that likely would’ve been vetoed under Obama. Many elected officials and policymakers blamed reduced oversight for the 2008 financial crisis, which triggered the longest and deepest recession since the 1930s.

One person familiar with JPMorgan’s plans said regulation was only partly to blame for JPMorgan not broadening its consumer bank in the decade after the crisis. The bank constantly evaluated ways to expand the consumer bank, but executives were hesitant due to the cost and difficulty, the person said.

JPMorgan is embarking on the biggest expansion of its consumer bank in a decade as new liquidity rules encourage banks to draw more funding from deposits, which tend to be cheaper, and rising interest rates stiffen the competition for retail customers. Bank of America also announced plans to open up branches in new markets earlier this year.

“I’ve been waiting to do this for 10 years,” Dimon said in September.

T10-24,9nexnr,Some companies might be rated junk already if not for leniency from credit raters,1539299320.0,8,20,"April 25, 2018: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-25/a-3-trillion-credit-market-has-corporate-bond-investors-on-edge

> The high-grade bond market in the U.S. already has the lowest credit quality mix since the 1980s, according to CreditSights, and there are signs investors are getting nervous. A Bloomberg Barclays gauge of average corporate bond spreads has surged to a six-month high since since reaching an all-time low in early February.

> The big push into the bottom end of high-grade bonds was driven by the search for yield amid record-low rates following the 2008 financial crisis and unprecedented stimulus from central banks. Investors who were comfortable in A-rated bonds moved to BBBs, and those who were comfortable in BBBs dipped into high yield, according to Lyons of CreditSights.

> “What happens when that all retraces?” she said.

October 11, 2018: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-almost-junk-credit-ratings/

> Bloomberg News delved into 50 of the biggest corporate acquisitions over the last five years, and found:

> -    By one key measure, more than half of the acquiring companies pushed their leverage to levels typical of junk-rated peers. But those companies, which have almost $1 trillion of debt, have been allowed to maintain investment-grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings.

> -    The vast majority of the 50 deals—valued at $1.9 trillion collectively—were financed with debt.

> -    This M&A-fueled leveraging of corporate balance sheets contributed to a surge in debt rated in the bottom investment-grade tier and now represents almost half of the outstanding market, Bloomberg Barclays index data show.

> “The rating agencies are giving companies too much wiggle room,” said Tom Murphy, a money manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “There’s been some pretty heroic assumptions around cost savings and debt repayments laid out by some borrowers involved in mergers.”

> Take Campbell Soup Co. The company borrowed more than $6 billion in the past year to buy Snyder’s-Lance Inc., the maker of pretzels and other snacks. The acquisition more than doubled the company’s debt load to nearly $10 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company now has more than 5 times as much debt as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure known as Ebitda, according to Moody’s.

> While ratings firms evaluate a number of criteria, a company with leverage that high would be considered junk if judged on that metric alone. For example, two Campbell Soup competitors, Pinnacle Foods Inc. and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc., have lower leverage and are rated below investment-grade. But Moody’s and S&P kept Campbell at investment-grade, saying they expected the merged food company to generate enough revenue to pay down its debt quickly.

> Companies have had little reason to keep their credit ratings high during a decade of easy money, as investors worldwide shifted trillions of dollars into riskier bonds in search of higher yields. A company that was looking to borrow debt for seven years would pay just 0.5 extra percentage point in interest annually if it were rated in the BBB tier instead of the A tier, according to Bloomberg data. That amounts to just $5 million more a year for every additional $1 billion the company borrows. In October 2011, that difference would have been almost twice as high.

TL;DR: High levels of corporate debt, low financial incentive to maintain higher credit ratings, and credit rating agencies might be slow with updating the ratings (07-08' mortgage-backed securities' credit ratings anyone?).",0.8,"[""You mean GE with an assload of debt and deteiorating cash flows, pension liabilities and big negative surprises every other month shouldn't be investment grade?"", 'A lot of these loans were done (and still are being done) “covenant light,” meaning that debt doesn’t carry many (or any) of the traditional loan covenants that, if breached, would (or could) trigger an event of default for something other than non-payment. These would be things like requirements to maintain certain financial ratios (usually around leverage and balance sheet liquidity ratios of the sort that fees Altman’s Z, current ratio, quick ratio, etc.). Eliminating these meant that lenders, in an otherwise very low interest rate environment, could ask for higher yield as compensation for giving up these protections. A similar phenomenon prevailed in the leveraged loan markets in 2005.\n\nThe most recent batch of covenant light debt started picking up in 2013, and has increased since then. These loans are usually floating rate, with interest only until maturity, at which point the outstanding principal is due in a bullet. Typical maturity is around 7 years, sometimes 5, sometimes as long as 10. \n\nThat’s one reason (among many) that we haven’t seen more than a trickle of corporate debt defaults and accompanying restructuring a or bankruptcies over the last 5 or so years. After the post-crisis deleveraging, most of the crappier debt was eliminated, and then there really wasn’t a lot of major corporate lending, particularly in the leverage loan space, until things started picking back up — covenant light — in 2012. \n\nSo most of these companies, even as leveraged as they are, continue to be able to make interest payments. We’ll probably see an initial uptick in defaults as rates rise, which could cause some of the weaker borrowers with a lot of floating rate debt to miss payments. But it’ll be another two years before the amount of maturing debt really starts to grow (peaking, IIRC, in 2022, give or take a year). At that point, these borrowers will have to tap credit markets for refinancing. \n\nI suspect that’t the point where we’ll see another wave of corporate financial restructurings. A fair number of those borrowers will not have grown their business enough, or realized enough “synergies,” following their last leveraged transaction, to support new financing in an amount large enough to pay off the maturing debt, particularly at higher interest rates and with more restrictive covenants. And they certainly don’t have the cash on their balance sheets to make up the difference. So that will mean deleveraging through debt workouts and bankruptcy filings in anticipation of or shortly after payment default. ', 'Love your threads, hope to see more from you.']"

SPGI10-25,9nexnr,Some companies might be rated junk already if not for leniency from credit raters,1539299320.0,8,17,"April 25, 2018: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-25/a-3-trillion-credit-market-has-corporate-bond-investors-on-edge

> The high-grade bond market in the U.S. already has the lowest credit quality mix since the 1980s, according to CreditSights, and there are signs investors are getting nervous. A Bloomberg Barclays gauge of average corporate bond spreads has surged to a six-month high since since reaching an all-time low in early February.

> The big push into the bottom end of high-grade bonds was driven by the search for yield amid record-low rates following the 2008 financial crisis and unprecedented stimulus from central banks. Investors who were comfortable in A-rated bonds moved to BBBs, and those who were comfortable in BBBs dipped into high yield, according to Lyons of CreditSights.

> “What happens when that all retraces?” she said.

October 11, 2018: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-almost-junk-credit-ratings/

> Bloomberg News delved into 50 of the biggest corporate acquisitions over the last five years, and found:

> -    By one key measure, more than half of the acquiring companies pushed their leverage to levels typical of junk-rated peers. But those companies, which have almost $1 trillion of debt, have been allowed to maintain investment-grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings.

> -    The vast majority of the 50 deals—valued at $1.9 trillion collectively—were financed with debt.

> -    This M&A-fueled leveraging of corporate balance sheets contributed to a surge in debt rated in the bottom investment-grade tier and now represents almost half of the outstanding market, Bloomberg Barclays index data show.

> “The rating agencies are giving companies too much wiggle room,” said Tom Murphy, a money manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “There’s been some pretty heroic assumptions around cost savings and debt repayments laid out by some borrowers involved in mergers.”

> Take Campbell Soup Co. The company borrowed more than $6 billion in the past year to buy Snyder’s-Lance Inc., the maker of pretzels and other snacks. The acquisition more than doubled the company’s debt load to nearly $10 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company now has more than 5 times as much debt as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure known as Ebitda, according to Moody’s.

> While ratings firms evaluate a number of criteria, a company with leverage that high would be considered junk if judged on that metric alone. For example, two Campbell Soup competitors, Pinnacle Foods Inc. and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc., have lower leverage and are rated below investment-grade. But Moody’s and S&P kept Campbell at investment-grade, saying they expected the merged food company to generate enough revenue to pay down its debt quickly.

> Companies have had little reason to keep their credit ratings high during a decade of easy money, as investors worldwide shifted trillions of dollars into riskier bonds in search of higher yields. A company that was looking to borrow debt for seven years would pay just 0.5 extra percentage point in interest annually if it were rated in the BBB tier instead of the A tier, according to Bloomberg data. That amounts to just $5 million more a year for every additional $1 billion the company borrows. In October 2011, that difference would have been almost twice as high.

TL;DR: High levels of corporate debt, low financial incentive to maintain higher credit ratings, and credit rating agencies might be slow with updating the ratings (07-08' mortgage-backed securities' credit ratings anyone?).",0.76,"[""You mean GE with an assload of debt and deteiorating cash flows, pension liabilities and big negative surprises every other month shouldn't be investment grade?"", 'A lot of these loans were done (and still are being done) “covenant light,” meaning that debt doesn’t carry many (or any) of the traditional loan covenants that, if breached, would (or could) trigger an event of default for something other than non-payment. These would be things like requirements to maintain certain financial ratios (usually around leverage and balance sheet liquidity ratios of the sort that fees Altman’s Z, current ratio, quick ratio, etc.). Eliminating these meant that lenders, in an otherwise very low interest rate environment, could ask for higher yield as compensation for giving up these protections. A similar phenomenon prevailed in the leveraged loan markets in 2005.\n\nThe most recent batch of covenant light debt started picking up in 2013, and has increased since then. These loans are usually floating rate, with interest only until maturity, at which point the outstanding principal is due in a bullet. Typical maturity is around 7 years, sometimes 5, sometimes as long as 10. \n\nThat’s one reason (among many) that we haven’t seen more than a trickle of corporate debt defaults and accompanying restructuring a or bankruptcies over the last 5 or so years. After the post-crisis deleveraging, most of the crappier debt was eliminated, and then there really wasn’t a lot of major corporate lending, particularly in the leverage loan space, until things started picking back up — covenant light — in 2012. \n\nSo most of these companies, even as leveraged as they are, continue to be able to make interest payments. We’ll probably see an initial uptick in defaults as rates rise, which could cause some of the weaker borrowers with a lot of floating rate debt to miss payments. But it’ll be another two years before the amount of maturing debt really starts to grow (peaking, IIRC, in 2022, give or take a year). At that point, these borrowers will have to tap credit markets for refinancing. \n\nI suspect that’t the point where we’ll see another wave of corporate financial restructurings. A fair number of those borrowers will not have grown their business enough, or realized enough “synergies,” following their last leveraged transaction, to support new financing in an amount large enough to pay off the maturing debt, particularly at higher interest rates and with more restrictive covenants. And they certainly don’t have the cash on their balance sheets to make up the difference. So that will mean deleveraging through debt workouts and bankruptcy filings in anticipation of or shortly after payment default. ', 'Love your threads, hope to see more from you.']"

PSA10-30,9k2b5r,Thoughts on this High Dividend/Holding Portfolio? (REITS + Strong Dividend Leaders),1538270726.0,19,8,"So Im going to be making an m1 brokerage account (Normal). I opened up a Roth IRA With vanguard and put your usual boring ETF/Index funds stocks that I won't touch till I retire. Also pre-apologies of this being a long post.

HOWEVER, I did want to have something for the intermediate length term that I can watch and learn. I have my Robinhood account I put very little in (were talking like 20 bucks a month) to just play around with. This however is meant to just grow for the intermediate term, aimed at mainly doing dividends with strong companies for the long term. I wanted to have a piece of multiple sectors that I feel are long term plays but I wanted everyone's thoughts **(Suggestions are def. wanted! Im a beginner, this is just my feeling and some basic research i've done so im not claiming anything purely asking advice)**. Also remember this is NOT my roth IRA or 401k. This is something im going to be intermediately funding to learn more about the market and for intermediate to long term growth. I will not be putting all of my money in these or anything.

1. REITS: I do want some of these as they typically pay good dividends and are ""relatively"" stable, however the normal real estate ones don't interest me. This would probably not make up a huge portion of my m1 ""Pie"" but I do like some of these (Besides Reality Income Corp which is boring but strong performance). With interest rates rising I don't see this as a good buy right now....plus I feel like Millennial's probably won't be buying as many houses in the next few years. Just doesn't feel strong.......HOWEVER the following do feel like strong ones:

* Data Center REIT's:  Equinix/DLR and Coresite all seem appealing, I know in 2018 they've hit a dive........but that seems like maybe the best time to buy while they are a little bit low. I know rising interest rates obviously will affect them...but with everything in the world going digital and companies storing more data than ever I see this being strong in the future.  (If you had to pick which ones would you?). I also feel like Iron Mountain fits in here too (as they seem to be a pretty strong dividend wise....but i've heard some shakiness in their long term strategy from doing some research).
* Industrial REIT's: As retail places move more towards online (Amazon/Etc...) this seems like a very strong buy and hold (Good dividends, and I think online stores and shipping are clearly more the norm nowadays). Prologis is the one I know is amazons biggest one, but i'd like to hear of others too.
* Infrastructure REITS: Same reason as above, I only see this industry growing (as it currently is). SBAC and AMT are two that stand out (Although I don't believe SBAC pays out dividends, but it still seems like a strong growth option). I don't know much about the area but i'd like to hear of others.
* Senior Home/Health living facility REITS: SNH and VTR are two high dividend payers that I feel are pretty recession proof...I mean even as medicine advances health care facilities (especially senior health care facilities for all the baby boomers) I see are going to be even a bigger necessity.
* Timberland/Farmland/Specialty: These are specialty ones, I like Gladstone Land(LAND), they've had 2 large farmland acquisitions (I file this under the ""people gotta eat"", plus they are relatively inexpensive). FPI has had some issues it seems. As far as Timber I honestly have zero clue,  Weyerhauser has been mentioned as being pretty strong...but im not knowledgeable about it. It seems like it'd be a solid long holding. However I don't know how in-line Timber is affected by a slowing real estate market (or what I feel is going to be).
* Manufactured Homes/Apartments/Retail/Public Storage: Retail feels like it will be def. on a downturn, Im too uncomfortable about Manufactured Homes to want to invest in their REITS. Apartments ""feel"" like they may become more popular.....but I really have a tough time  knowing what their future is with rising interest rates. Also not knowledgeable enough on public storage (i've heard mixed reviews on their future).

1. Energy/Utilities: I'd like to have some solid high dividend energy stocks. Preferably some in renewable energy as well. However I am completely ignorant about this sector. Dominion and Duke seem popular, No idea on some of the ""Big oil"" companies. I'd like to throw in some in some renewable energy companies (Which Im sure are very low now since Trump doesn't seem to have any interest in them) but it's a matter of time (And might as well buy while they are low)
2. Tech: I feel like there is enough information out there on these and which ones are solid.
3. Bonds: No idea on these??? I think they would be good to have to diversify. I don't think they should make up a significant portion however.
4. Consumer/Industrials: I like Costco/Walmart here, as well as Coke/Pepsi. For Industrials I like UPS (goes along with the ""Shipping everything nowadays"" as well as 3M/Boeing and Waste Management. Also Caterpillar because eventually infrastructure WILL become a problem (it already is) so this seems obvious to stick in.

AIV11-01,9o9w1u,Sears files for bankruptcy,1539581074.0,639,3668,"Per CNBC - After years of [Sears Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SHLD) staying afloat through financial maneuvering and relying on billions of CEO Eddie Lampert's own money, the 125-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy.

The filing comes more than a decade after Lampert merged Sears and Kmart, hoping that forging together the two struggling discounters would create a more formidable competitor.

It comes after Lampert [shed assets and spun out real estate](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/eddie-lampert-says-sears-is-shrinking-shedding-assets-to-stay-alive.html), all to pay down the debt the retailer accumulated when that plan went askew. The company still has roughly 700 stores, which have at times been barren, unstocked by vendors who have lost their trust. Many of the stores have never been visited by a generation of shoppers that can barely recall it was once the the country's biggest retailer.

Lampert, who has a controlling ownership stake in Sears, personally holds some 31 percent of the retailer's shares outstanding, according to FactSet. His hedge fund ESL Investments owns about 19 percent.

Ultimately, it was a $134 million payment that did the company in. The company had a payment due Monday it had not the money to pay.

Other forces were at play too. Sears' creditors refused to agree to a [restructuring proposal](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/sears-ceo-proposes-restructuring-plan-to-avoid-bankruptcy.html). They had little assurance by way of collateral or strategy, after years upon years in which Sears' only shot at survival came by selling off parts of its business. Over 42 quarters, only one yielded positive same-store sales growth. As of late September, Sears tallied $5.6 billion in current debt.

Its board was in a perilous spot. Its special committee was tasked with approving Lampert's other plan, [a bid to buy his storied Kenmore appliance business and other brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/eddie-lamperts-hedge-fund-esl-proposes-to-buy-kenmore-brand-sears-real-estate.html). Approving his offer would have helped Sears make its payment. But it would also thrust the board the spotlight, potentially opening them to the threat of litigation from shareholders who might allege Lampert has stripped the business bare.

#### Homes to Hardware

That business was once a giant. It started with Richard Sears, [who launched the Sears Watch Co. in 1886](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html) to sell watches by mail. The company later evolved into Sears, Roebuck and Co., which sold everything from homes to hardware through a catalog. The convenience brought its products to America's most rural locations.

In 1925, Sears morphed a mail-order plant on Chicago's West Side into its first retail store. By the end of the year. Sears opened seven more stores. Eventually, Sears became the largest U.S. retailer, and its house brands like Kenmore and Craftsman earned spots as staples in homes across the country. Generations of children marked the holidays by paging through its holiday catalog, known as the ""Wishbook,"" wondering if they would receive any of the toys inside.

As Sears success grew, so did its empire. It moved into Chicago's iconic Sears Tower, and for a time, owned financial services businesses like Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group.

But [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) topped Sears as the biggest U.S. retailer in 1990. Its efforts to attract female shoppers by showing them the ""softer side of Sears"" and move into new businesses lines left it without a identity.

Those challenges didn't stop Lampert, the hedge fund manager who had already impressed Wall Street with his acumen when he seemingly turned around Kmart, which he bought in 2004. He acquired and combined Sears with Kmart in 2005, arguing that two ailing retailers were stronger together than apart. The financial guru saw valuable real estate, customers he could parlay from one store to the other and ample costs to cut.

The retail giant he created had a market capitalization north of $20 billion in 2006. The media began to wonder whether he was the ""next Warren Buffett."" Lampert could have sold off his investments then, but stayed on, steadfast in his vision of the combined retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) kept opening stores, as did [Lowe's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LOW)and [Home Depot](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HD). Walmart touted its ""everyday low prices,"" while Target served up ""cheap chic."" Lowe's and Home Depot provided a wider array of home improvement products for all kinds of projects, making it tough for Kenmore and Craftsman to compete.

Then, came a double blow.

Consumer spending slowed during the Great Recession, especially for big-ticket items like washers and dryers. Cash-strapped shoppers began using the internet to hunt down the best deals. Gradually, they began to spend more online and avoid the mall, fueling Amazon's rise. Sears' 140,000-square-foot stores began to seem monstrous as foot traffic declined.

Walmart and others began to invest in their businesses to compete with Amazon, but Sears never had that chance. It simply didn't have the funds.

Sears' last profitable year was in 2010. A thinning cash flow has left little money to put back into the company itself, letting it become more irrelevant. For the past five years, the ratio of Sears' capital expenditures to sales has been less than one percent. That's even as its sales have more than halved in the same time period.

Sears has been in survival mode for more than a decade. Unable to rely on the Sears' business to pay the bills, [Lampert instead sold or spun off many of its most valuable stores and brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html).

Since its merger with Kmart, Sears has spun off its Lands' End clothing brand, sold the Craftsman tool brand to [Stanley Black & Decker](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/) and closed hundreds of stores. It spun out 250 of its best properties into real estate investment trust offshoot known as [Seritage](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SRG).

Its key vendors, wary of Sears' future, [demanded tighter payment terms](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/08/sears-same-store-sales-q3-2017.html). Some, like Whirlpool, [stopped shipping all-together.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/sears-cuts-ties-with-whirlpool-and-will-stop-selling-its-appliances.html)

It has been grappling with a pension of roughly 100,000 retirees that, as of January 2018, was underfunded by $1.5 billion, according FactSet.

It became a guessing game among analysts and onlookers whether each of Sears' last five holiday seasons would be its last. But Lampert kept surprising them, extending a lifeline in the form of loans from his hedge fund ESL Investments, or finding them elsewhere, each time bankruptcy looked inevitable.

Lampert, though, sounded the alarm in a Sept. 13 [blog post](https://blog.searsholdings.com/eddie-lampert/update-on-our-transformation/). He pleaded for Sears' creditor's to agree to restructure, calling out the risks should they drag their feet.

""We continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern, rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value,"" he wrote.

By early October, it became evident that Sears' last Christmas before bankruptcy had already passed. Sears began to [raise emergency financing to support the business through coming filing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/sears-arranges-financing-for-a-potential-bankruptcy.html).

Now, the question will be whether Sears will be able to come out of bankruptcy. [Retailers don't have a great track record of emerging](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/here-are-the-retailers-that-have-filed-for-bankruptcy-so-far-this-year.html).

Our numbers at the time showed we were losing nearly $1 million a year on comforters (of all things). Where were they placed? Right next to the large mall entrance farthest away from our camera room. Even if we did manage to see them select and conceal it, the chance of grabbing them once they left the store was minimal. To top it all off, the back corner of the section was a blind spot, so even if the did walk in without it then leave with it, our policy for stopping shoplifters said we needed to have the selection and concealment on camera and we couldn't do anything about it without dancing on the line. \n\nThe biggest thing that didn't make sense to me was we were discouraged to stop shoplifters that stole anything worth $20 or less. I can tell you that unless the person got wild, this was a majority of what we saw. Granted, a necklace worth $15 is nothing compared to other big ticket items, but when you see 3 or 4 a day? Guess what, you're losing money. And that report we wrote that concluded with 'no stop made' was rarely looked into, deemed not worth it. \n\nMy point of view on Sears is definitely more from the bottom than the investors at the top, but I feel like even if the creditors did want to restructure, they would still need to completely overhaul their physical set up and their asset protection department.

AIZ11-06,9rtzzy,The U.S. Secretly Halted JPMorgan’s Growth for Years [Bloomberg],1540644520.0,19,4,"For almost six years, Washington secretly shackled JPMorgan Chase & Co., the nation’s biggest bank.

Now the chains are off, thanks to bank-friendly regulators in the Trump administration.

In actions never before made public, Obama administration regulators prevented the bank from opening branches in new states as punishment for violating banking rules, according to people familiar with the matter. JPMorgan’s ambitious plan to expand nationally, announced earlier this year, was made possible by the Trump administration’s rollback of those restraints, which date from 2012, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing regulators’ impact on the bank’s plans.

JPMorgan has racked up more than $30 billion in penalties, legal costs and related obligations since the 2008 financial crisis, some of which stemmed from its acquisitions of Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc. Missteps include excessive risk taken by the London Whale trader and failing to flag transactions related to Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Privately, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency stopped JPMorgan from expanding into additional states while resolving compliance breakdowns as part of an unwritten regulatory policy, the people said.

Expansion Ban
While banks often have private conversations with regulators and even gauge their reactions to potential plans, the people with knowledge of the matter described the ban as one of the more extreme ways they exerted their control behind the scenes.

Regulators went to even harsher lengths earlier this year to punish Wells Fargo & Co., placing a cap on its assets after a pattern of lapses and abuses. Janet Yellen, who served as Federal Reserve chair under President Barack Obama, announced the unprecedented punishment on her final workday in office.

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, operated 5,130 branches in 23 states at the end of last year. With fresh assurances from regulators under President Donald Trump, the people said, it’s planning to open 400 branches in as many as 20 new markets in the next five years, including plans to build in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. This is the first time the bank is opening branches in a new state in more than a decade. The moves could translate into an additional $1.5 billion of revenue a year by 2022, according to Morgan Stanley.

‘Extremely Excited’
“We are extremely excited to be expanding again, as smart regulatory policy and a competitive corporate tax system help us to deliver on our commitment to invest in our customers and communities,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said Oct. 12.

JPMorgan has resolved many of its compliance issues, but the OCC still has open enforcement actions against the bank, according to agency data.

Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the bank wouldn’t comment on supervisory issues.

“Opening new branches is a sustainable and long-term investment in the communities we serve,” Gray said. “Entering new markets will bring the full force of JPMorgan Chase’s business and philanthropic capabilities, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and allow us to serve more customers and local businesses by lending and investing in their community.”

OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard declined to comment.

New Branches
In loosening their grip on JPMorgan, authorities removed a critical barrier to the lender’s growth. A 1994 law prohibits mergers between banks if the transaction would give any of them control of more than 10 percent of U.S. deposits. With $1.3 trillion, JPMorgan already controls more than 10 percent -- second only to Bank of America Corp. -- which means adding branches in new markets is one of its only avenues for expansion.


Joseph OttingPhotographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg
The reversal comes amid anti-regulatory fervor under Trump. It’s also consistent with the declared willingness of the new OCC head, Joseph Otting, to give financial institutions more flexibility when resolving concerns raised by OCC staff. Otting worked closely with future Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at OneWest Bank, now part of CIT Group Inc., when the lender came under fire for its mortgage-servicing business.

The OCC has softened its approach to overseeing banks from the aggressive tone under Thomas Curry, who led the agency from 2012 to 2017. Curry instituted tough standards in an effort to change the perception that regulators were too close to the institutions they were meant to police.

Relaxed Stance
Banks are responding to friendlier regulators under Trump by pushing into new markets and reassessing deals that likely would’ve been vetoed under Obama. Many elected officials and policymakers blamed reduced oversight for the 2008 financial crisis, which triggered the longest and deepest recession since the 1930s.

One person familiar with JPMorgan’s plans said regulation was only partly to blame for JPMorgan not broadening its consumer bank in the decade after the crisis. The bank constantly evaluated ways to expand the consumer bank, but executives were hesitant due to the cost and difficulty, the person said.

JPMorgan is embarking on the biggest expansion of its consumer bank in a decade as new liquidity rules encourage banks to draw more funding from deposits, which tend to be cheaper, and rising interest rates stiffen the competition for retail customers. Bank of America also announced plans to open up branches in new markets earlier this year.

“I’ve been waiting to do this for 10 years,” Dimon said in September.

1. **This company doesn't sell weed**. Their products contain minimal THC and is legally sold in the US as a ""natural"" CBD product derived from hemp.

2. The CBD market [will probably](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarabrittanysomerset/2018/09/12/will-cbd-entirely-eclipse-the-cannabis-market/#27af35c97beb) be [much larger](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/new-study-cbd-market-22-billion-2022-722852/) than the THC market. As well, with recreational cannabis slowly becoming legal, it's providing a much easier avenue for people to try CBD products. In the last two years, the US market for hemp-derived CBD supplements has experienced robust growth and is expected to grow at a 55% CAGR over 2016-2021, according to the Brightfield Group ([from the cannacord report](http://cdn.ceo.ca.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1dq4vhg-CWEB%2B-%2BInitiation.pdf)).

3. CBD can help with a huge array of problems, such as anxiety (CBD oil / pills), focus (CBD tea), joint pain (CBD cream), seizures, sleep-aids, and many others.

Here's a quick break-down of their stats (3 months ended June 30th 2018):

* Retail locations: 2,700 ([now past 3000](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/cbd-leader-charlottes-web-holdings-inc-surpasses-3000-locations-as-mainstream-market-grows-697670241.html))
* Revenues: $17.2m
* Gross Profit: $13.2m
* Gross Profit Margin: 76%
* Adj EBITDA: $6.1m
* Net Income: $3.7m
* Fully Diluted Shares: 106m
* Mkt Cap: $1.47Bln
* #1 in CBD market share in the US
* **Low float** due to **insiders owning 44%** of the shares, including the Stanley Brothers (who started the company) who own 34%. The IPO lock-out is 180 days for them.
* Currently trading ~$15 CAD since their $7 IPO, with a price target of $21.

I highly recommend checking out [the Canaccord coverage of them](http://cdn.ceo.ca.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1dq4vhg-CWEB%2B-%2BInitiation.pdf) which has a huge amount of info.

**But there's no free money**, this company has risks don't get me wrong. One risk is the 2018 Farm bill which will remove hemp as a Schedule-I drug. This would help CWEB producer easier and get them out of the legal ambiguity they are in today. Another risk is if the FDA suddenly decides to crack-down on their 'health benefits' claims.

Despite the risks I think CWEB is a solid growth holding with a lot of potential, and I think their branding and products are much better than any of the competition (including $CVSI).",0.65,"['"" I think their branding and products are much better than any of the competition ""\n\nAgreed.\n\n""The CBD market will probably be much larger than the THC market.

Good post and I've been eyeing this company since their IPO. Thought it would have performed better so far but still want a small piece of this company.

Not sure if anyone will corner this market but this is a well known brand since they started saving epileptic kids with a great new weed strain. It was impossible to get for most and now the oil can be had buy anybody. Will be interesting if big pharma can hold CBD back at the federal level but I doubt it given current momentum.

Mostly to see why they did what they did. In that analysis lies (I believe) valuable information about investor behaviour, preferences and latent value to be captured. If nothing else, I believe the companies below and the sectors/industries to which they are assigned represent the answer to what is often asked on these board, i.e. ""Which stocks/sectors/industries do better than the market in a bear market or recession?""

Looking just at the sp500, there were 30 companies which closed on Friday, at a higher price than their price on Monday. Enjoy your analysis of the below. Just a note that of the companies below only 1 had an earnings release this week (Walgreens), so that can be struck off as the reason for these stocks' contra-market move.
